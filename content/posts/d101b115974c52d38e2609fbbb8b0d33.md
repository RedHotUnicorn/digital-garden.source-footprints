 Say we want to extract topics for the document as a whole. So we:1. Split into individual paragraphs 2. Extract topics for each paragraph independently 3. Somehow combine topics across paragraphs, to get document level topics.  I'm interested in how best to perform step 3. I guess we'd end up with paragraph level topic weightings if we take this approach, and it's not clear how best to combine these paragraph level results to an overall document level, ie what our the most prevalent topics overall in the document? I'm sure I can come up with an approach, but wanted to check whether's a recommended approach for this (probably fairly common) problem, or any examples you could point to? |
