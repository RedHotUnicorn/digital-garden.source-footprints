**It’s like podcasts** — but for *reading*.


NetNewsWire shows you articles from your favorite blogs and news sites and keeps track of what you’ve read.


This means you can stop going from page to page in your browser looking for new articles to read. Do it the easy way instead: let NetNewsWire bring you the news.


And, if you’ve been getting your news via Facebook and Twitter — with their ads, algorithms, user tracking, outrage, and misinformation — you can switch to NetNewsWire to get news directly and more reliably from the sites you trust.


Take back control of your news. With free, high-quality, native apps for Mac and iOS.
