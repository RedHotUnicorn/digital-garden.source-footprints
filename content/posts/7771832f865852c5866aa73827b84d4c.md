Creating a table of content for a markdown file — Image created by author.

A while ago I was writing a lot of articles in markdown for the DevGuide of my company — we use Hugo to build it as an internal website — and got annoyed by the very repetitive and honestly very tiresome task of creating and adapting the table of contents (TOC). Whenever I changed a header, introduced new sub-chapters or removed others I had to manually edit the table of contents — again and again. After doing this while reviewing and editing a couple more articles I finally got tired enough of it to look for tools and “easy-to-use” but configurable options out there. Color me surprised by the lack thereof.

So I decided to write my own minimal CLI tool to extract the table of contents (TOC) from markdown files automatically. In this article I will present the requirements, design decisions and core functionality necessary for the implementation. The project is [open source](https://github.com/CribberSix/markdown-toc-extract) of course and can be extended by anyone who pleases to do so.

**Requirements and initial thoughts**
=====================================

As the TOC is often placed in different positions in a markdown file there is no point to insert it into the first line of the file by default. For instance both [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) require the first couple of lines of markdown files to consist of their individual front-matter.

In general, it is a bad idea to edit the file itself. Things go wrong once in a while. Ideally we want the final decision (to insert the TOC) to remain in our own hands. We are only able to automate decisions if we can accurately define the decision parameters and optimal outcome — which in this case would be the syntactic content and “feel” of the chapter headers. Difficult to automate.

In conclusion, it meant the TOC should ideally

* be returned to the console to check the results and enable copy-pasting (this needs to be the default),
* optionally be placed in the clipboard,
* optionally be copied into the first line of the file,
* optionally be placed in a separate file altogether.

Furthermore, we should enable users to limit the depth of the TOC by setting a custom limit to the levels of headers that are included. Some prefer a table of contents three header-levels deep, others only like to see the main ones.

**Format considerations**
=========================

Concerning the actual format of the TOC itself enumerated, clickable links to chapters should be preferred. Maybe this is just my laziness, but if the TOC cannot be clicked and i cannot jump to the chapter that interests me, what’s the point of creating a table oc content. This means we need one of the following output formats:

The first option which is more commonly used:



GitLab flavor of markdown for TOC-links.

Or the second option with HTML anchors:



HTML anchors for the TOC-links.

The second option necessitates inserting and formatting anchors in the existing markdown file, as well as introducing HTML into the markdown files. Both things which are difficult to argue for — and I am not particularly fond of.

They are also in conflict to the above requirements as we don’t necessarily want to insert the TOC directly into the file, especially not multiple, separated anchor-lines all over the place. Keeping in mind that we aim for a small and easy-to-use solution, the decision is clearly in favor of the first format.

**The core functionality**
==========================

After clearing up initial design decisions and our self-set requirements, let’s have a look at the needed functionality. In general, we have the following steps:

1. Reading the file
2. Cleaning the file
3. Identifying headers
4. Formatting headers
5. Creating the TOC
6. Outputting the TOC

Let’s get to it.

Reading the file
----------------

We don’t have to do anything fancy here, we simply read the file and split it based on newline characters into individual lines.



Reading the file.

Sidenote: I prefer the above syntax above to using `readlines()`, as `readlines()` returns the lines with a closing newline character which will have to be cleaned up later. We can also load the entire file into memory at once since markdown files rarely have gigabytes of data.

Cleaning the file
-----------------

Before extracting the headers, we need to remove all code blocks and their contents from the file content. Python (among other programming languages) can have valid hashtags as leading characters in a line (e.g. as comments) which would clash with our detection of headers. Since this is a simple transformative step, we can write a quick function for it.



The function receives a list of lines, filters out any code blocks and returns the filtered list.

**Identifying header lines**
----------------------------

There are two ways of creating headers in markdown

* the common option of using a certain number of hashtags (`#`) *in the same line* ahead of the header title
* alternatively, *in the next line below,* add any number of equal signs(`=`) for a header of level 1 or hyphens (`-`) for headers of level 2.

The obvious downside (aside from it being ugly as hell) of the second alternative is that the syntax limits us to two levels of headers. So far I also have luckily been spared of seeing the second format in projects which I was a part of. However, to ensure full functionality, let’s include methods of identification for both formats.

The logic to detect the common type of header line is pretty straightforward: we can use a regex pattern to identify a line as a header line: `r"^#+\ .*$"` (Leading hashtags, followed by a space, then any possible characters).

For the other type of headers we simply check whether the line starts with equal signs (regex: `r"^=+ *$"`) or hyphens (regex: `r"^-+ *$"`) and doesn't have any other characters until the end of the line besides spaces. If so, we add the *previous* line as a header. In order to save ourselves trouble in the next step, we will also unify the header format.



Identifying header lines and filtering out other lines.

Example transformation:

**Formatting headers**
----------------------

After identifying headers, we need to determine their level and create the formatted lines for the table of contents itself.

From the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#header-ids-and-links) we can learn how to format commonly used markdown links in a TOC:

1. All text is converted to lowercase.
2. All non-word text (such as punctuation or HTML) is removed.
3. All spaces are converted to hyphen.
4. Two or more hyphens in a row are converted to one.
5. If a header with the same ID has already been generated, a unique incrementing number is appended, starting at 1.

The following function will cover most of those rules — admittedly in some edge cases the link will fail, but for 95% we are good to go. Perfection is admirable, but the amount of time needed to find edge cases and implement solutions for those just isn’t worth it at the moment. When we (or other potential future users) do encounter an edge case which is necessary to take into account, we can always easily extend my code.

Creating the TOC
----------------

For the TOC itself we have to take care of formatting and numbering the headers and sub-headers. We also need to reset the numbering if the next header is of a higher level than the previous one.

Assembling each line as a string in the TOC consists of (in order):

* possible indentations for sub-headers,
* the header number,
* the header text and
* the link to the header.

We can also introduce a variable called `level_limit` in order to limit the depth of our TOC.



Creating the actual table of content lines.

Combining the work so far
-------------------------

We now have implemented the core functionality and can soon start looking at what is necessary to turn it into a CLI package and how to output the results.



Core functionality.

Outputting the TOC
------------------

Depending on the desired result, we copy the TOC to clipboard, insert it into the md-file or write it to a new file alltogether. This is mainly standard practice stuff, perhaps with the exception of finding an adequate file name for our new TOC file.



Writing the TOC to different channels.

Creating the CLI functionality
==============================

To be able to call the package from the command line with configurable arguments, we make use of the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module.

Remembering our requirements, we want the user to:

* specify the filename (obligatory argument)
* be able to copy the TOC to clipboard (optional argument `--copy`)
* be able to insert the TOC into the file (optional argument `--insert`)
* be able to save the TOC to a separate file (optional argument `--save`)
* be able to limit the depth of the TOC (optional argument `--levels <number-of-levels>`)

After creating our `ArgumentParser` with a name and description, we have to add each argument individually:



Creating the arguments for the CLI.

See the entirety of the arguments [in the file in the repository](https://github.com/CribberSix/markdown-toc-extract/blob/main/extracttoc/extracttoc.py).

Afterwards accessing the arguments / variables is as easy as:

The great thing is, we automatically get the functionality behind the `--help` argument included. The output here is:

**Packaging, publishing and accessing**
=======================================

Since we also want to be able install it on any other computer we ever get our hands on (and also make it available for other users) we can create a simple `setup.py` file, package the code and publish it on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/extracttoc/). Packaging a CLI tool is not different from any other python packaging process.

In case you are interested in the `setup.py` and how to package code, have a look

Quick sidenote: In order to test your packaged software without having to upload it to pypi and then install via pip, you can simply install it directly from the local directory in which your `setup.py` file is by using `pip install .` (yes that's a dot - signifying the current directory).

Finishing this step, everyone worldwide can now install the CLI tool using `pip install extracttoc`!

**Usage**
=========

Here are a couple of concrete usage examples how the tool works from the command line:

***Closing thoughts***
======================

Writing software to make your own life easier is good coding practice in general. However, creating open source packages (to help other people with the same problem) forces you to write good code *with high quality*, code that can be **understood** and **extended upon** by others. Things that you might not regard with a high priority in code that you assume no one will ever read (such as not naming your iteration variable merely `x` ...) suddenly have more weight when considering how others will be interacting with the code. Writing open source code that will at some point undoubtedly get criticized by others makes us pay attention to style and development best-practices - it makes us better programmers.

If you feel like you have free time to do so — try out the [package](https://pypi.org/project/extracttoc/) or have a look at the source code on [github](https://github.com/CribberSix/markdown-toc-extract) if you want to see it in the entirety!

Creating a CLI tool was new for me but is a very handy skill to have in my toolbox. I am certain that I will use it again in the future.
