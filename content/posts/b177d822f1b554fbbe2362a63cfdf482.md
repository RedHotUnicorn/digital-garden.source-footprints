A plugin to automatically create new links between notes in Obsidian.

### 🤨 How does it work?


The plugin checks each note in the vault for references to other note names (or their aliases).
If a reference is found, it gets added to a list. This list is then displayed to the user, who can select which notes to
link.


#### Disclaimer:


The current version has only been tested by myself, and a few beta testers. No bugs are currently known. However, I advise you to backup your vault before applying any changes using this plugin, since the plugin has not been tested by enough people.


### ⬇️ Installation

### 👨‍💻 Development


The plugin is written in Rust (compiled to WebAssembly) and TypeScript.
