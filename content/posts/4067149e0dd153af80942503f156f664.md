[All Articles](/blog)/Best PracticesLearn SQL for free: Our all-time favorite SQL learning resources
================================================================

25 free resources you can use to learn (and master) SQL.

Published on Apr 30, 2024 by AirOps TeamWhat is SQL?
------------

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is the standard language for communicating with relational databases.Â 

It's a relatively simple language as far as coding goes, but it's also incredibly powerful.Â 

You can write SQL statements to retrieve specific data from large databases, update data on a database, and much more. Relational database management systems like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Ingres use SQL.Â 

Why should you learn SQL?
-------------------------

In our data-hungry world, the ability to successfully work with data is becoming more and more valuable. It's an in-demand skill and not just for data analysts. Financial teams, programmers, and even non-technical people in marketing, sales, and other functions can all benefit from understanding what it takes to extract the data they need from a large database.

You don't necessarily need to become a SQL all-star, but understanding the basics will teach you how to ask better data-related questions (at the very least).
