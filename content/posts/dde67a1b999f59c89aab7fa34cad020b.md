I have file names in UTF-8, git handles them O.K, it will create files properly and github pages also display it right. Except that it will display it in console like below. Is it possible to make git display UTF-8 encoded characters beyond ASCII 127 in console properly?



```
git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   .gitignore
#       modified:   editfile.js
#       modified:   "\321\203\321\201\321\202\320\260\320\275\320\276\320\262"
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

UPDATE


I have been asked about my locale, here is the output of `locale` command



```
