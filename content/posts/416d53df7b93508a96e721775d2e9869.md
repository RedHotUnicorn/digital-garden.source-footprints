The post below contains a curated and regularly updated list of recommended apps for the desktop users (Windows & Linux).


All of the apps listed here are open source and [free as in freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software). 


If are looking for an alternative to one of the apps you are currently using, you should look at [alternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/).


Another great resource to find the answer to the question: "What are the best applications that..." is [Slant](https://www.slant.co/).


For a comprehensive list of privacy focused software, loot at [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) and at [PRISM break](https://prism-break.org/en/).


Linux users should look [here](https://github.com/luongvo209/Awesome-Linux-Software/blob/master/README.md) - this is a list with a vast number of different applications grouped in categories.


Moreover, because Flatpak is becoming the new cross distribution standard for publishing software, you can also check [Flathub](https://flathub.org/home) to discover new apps. 


Because the list is periodically updated, if you want to stay up to date with the latest additions and deletions, you can use the [Web Pages Scanner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-pages-scanner/) extension to be notified about any changes made here.

System
------


#### [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)


Because of the privacy concerns, you should not use Windows 10. There are [a lot of different Linux distros](https://distrowatch.com/) to choose from, but for me personally Manjaro is the best one when you want to start your Linux journey.


There are a few reasons for that:


* It just works out of the box. The recommendation is made for an average person and I assume that over 90% of them are still using Windows. So putting there the Arch Linux as a recommended OS would not make any sense, it would only discourage somebody from making the switch after a failed installation. Of course there are better alternatives for somebody looking for privacy and security solutions as Qubes OS, Whonix and Tails, but none of them can be recommended as a daily driver.
* Rolling release, so there is no need to reinstall it from time to time.
* Based on the amazing Arch Linux.
* It has access the AUR. And for me personally the Arch User Repository is the greatest thing about Arch - you have a one-click access to almost every app that could be run on Linux.


If you are a Linux veteran, you probably have your favourite Linux distro already, so you can just use it.


The best app to put the downloaded Manjaro ISO on a USB drive is [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html).

#### [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html)


VeraCrypt is a free open source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, based on TrueCrypt 7.1a.


VeraCrypt main features:


* Creates a **virtual encrypted disk** within a file and mounts it as a real disk.
* Encrypts an **entire partition or storage device** such as USB flash drive or hard drive.
* Encrypts a **partition or drive where Windows is installed** ([pre-boot authentication](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/System%20Encryption.html)).
* Encryption is
* [Parallelization](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Parallelization.html) and [pipelining](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Pipelining.html) allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted.
* Encryption can be [hardware-accelerated](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hardware%20Acceleration.html) on modern processors.
* Provides **[plausible deniability](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Plausible%20Deniability.html)**, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: **[Hidden volume](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Volume.html)** (steganography) and **[hidden operating system](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Operating%20System.html)**.


#### [Picocrypt](https://github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt)


Picocrypt is a very small (hence Pico), very simple, yet very secure encryption tool that you can use to protect your files. It's designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. It's designed for maximal security, making absolutely no compromises security-wise, and is built with Go's standard x/crypto modules. Your privacy and security are under attack. Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt.


#### [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)


Free client-side encryption for your cloud files. It creates a virtual hard drive called vault. Everything you put onto the virtual hard drive ends up encrypted.


Compared to other disk encryption utilities, Cryptomator encrypts each file individually. So if you edit just a small text file, only the corresponding encrypted file is changed.


This way the synchronization client of your cloud storage provider knows exactly what needs to be uploaded and what doesn't.


#### [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)


**KeePassXC** is a community fork of [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/), a native cross-platform port of [KeePass Password Safe](http://keepass.info), with the goal to extend and improve it with new features and bugfixes to provide a feature-rich, fully cross-platform and modern open-source password manager.


Currently the best password manager out there. It does not offer a cloud solution, but this is a feature - you should be the one who chooses where to store your own passwords.


You should use it together with [KeePass Tusk](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepass-tusk/), a Firefox extension which adds KeePass functionality to your browser and can autofill usernames and passwords.


Tusk can access KeePass files stored in Dropbox, Google Drive, Onedrive, PCloud, OwnCloud, and NextCloud.


#### [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)


Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's transmitted over the Internet.


Features:


* **Private.** None of your data is ever stored anywhere else other than on your computers. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally.
* **Encrypted.** All communication is secured using TLS. The encryption used includes perfect forward secrecy to prevent any eavesdropper from ever gaining access to your data.
* **Authenticated.** Every node is identified by a strong cryptographic certificate. Only nodes you have explicitly allowed can connect to your cluster.
* **Web GUI.** Configure and monitor Syncthing via a responsive and powerful interface accessible via your browser.
* **Portable.** Works on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, Android and BSD. Run it on your desktop computers and synchronize them with your server for backup.
* **Simple.** Syncthing doesn't need IP addresses or advanced configuration: it just works, over LAN and over the Internet. Every machine is identified by an ID. Just give your ID to your friends, share a folder and watch: UPnP will do if you don't want to port forward or you don't know how.
* **Powerful.** Synchronize as many folders as you need with different people.


#### [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/)


Free backup software to store encrypted backups online.


Duplicati works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV as well as popular services like Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive & S3, Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC and many others.

#### [Rymdport](https://github.com/Jacalz/rymdport)


Rymdport (formerly wormhole-gui) is a cross-platform application that lets you easily and safely share files, folders, and text between devices. The data is sent securely with end-to-end encryption using the same protocol as magic-wormhole. This means that Rymdport can talk not only to itself, but also to other wormhole clients.


The transfers are implemented using wormhole-william, a native Go implementation of magic-wormhole. As a result, Rymdport compiles into a native binary with no runtime dependencies while also outperforming the reference implementation of magic-wormhole.


#### [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)


OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size. A web server is started, making OnionShare accessible as a Tor Onion Service, potentially temporarily or in a stealthy manner, over the Internet. An unguessable address is generated and is shared for the recipient to open in the Tor Browser to download the files. No separate server or third party file-sharing service required. You host the files on your own computer.


The huge drawback of this software is that it is very slow, as the transfer is made through the Tor Network.


#### [Social Amnesia](https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia)


Social Amnesia aims to make your social media only exist within a time period that you choose. For many people, there is no reason they want to have years old tweets or reddit comments existing and making it easier for online marketers and jilted ex-lovers to profile you. With Social Amnesia, set the time period you want to keep, whitelist posts and items you want to preserve indefinitely, and let Social Amnesia wipe the rest out of existence.


Reddit:


* Delete comments and submissions, showing you every item that will be deleted and asking you to confirm their deletion before running.
* Edits your posts before deleting them. According to [the reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/c9qgbbb/) this is an effective way to remove content from reddit.
* Keep a time range of comments and submissions (in hours)
* Keep comments or submissions that are above a certain amount of upvotes.
* Skip gilded comments/submissions.
* Whitelist specific posts and comments you want to save.


Twitter:


* Delete tweets, retweets, replies and remove "favorites" (aka hearts), showing you every item that will be deleted/removed and asking you to confirm their deletion before running.
* Keep a time range of tweets, retweets, replies and favorites.
	+ In the case of favorites, this is done by the time the favorited item was created, NOT the time it was favorited at.
* Keep tweets that have a certain amount of retweets or favorites.
	+ This option ignores retweets, these will be removed no matter what if they are out of the time range.
* Whitelist specific tweets and favorites you want to save.


#### [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)


Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer.

#### [Metadata Cleaner](https://gitlab.com/rmnvgr/metadata-cleaner)


Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office applications automatically add author and company information to documents and spreadsheets. Maybe you don't want to disclose those informations.


This tool allows you to view metadata in your files and to get rid of them, as much as possible.


Under the hood, it relies on [mat2](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2) to parse and remove the metadata.


#### [Tron Script (Windows only)](https://old.reddit.com/r/TronScript/)


Tron is a collection of programs, tools, utilities, and Windows functions that are all scripted together. Those programs and such are designed to remove malware and bloatware, repair damaged operating systems, update old versions of very common applications, free up drive space by clearing out caches, and more. By consolidating and automating these tasks into a single execution it saves a lot of time and makes the whole process a lot more efficient.


Tron's intended goal is to take a badly-running Windows PC (bloated, infected with malware, neglected, etc) and automate about 85% of the work involved in getting it to run well again. There is nothing Tron does which you couldn't do on your own without it. Tron's real power is in its automation and the breadth of tools that it uses to achieve its intended goal.


Be sure to read the [Tron Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript/wiki/index#wiki_tron_wiki) before using it.

#### [PhotoRec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec)


[PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/) is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.


PhotoRec is free - this open source multi-platform application is distributed under [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GPLV v2+). PhotoRec is a companion program to [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk "TestDisk"), an application for recovering lost partitions on a wide variety of file systems and making non-bootable disks bootable again. You can download them from this [link](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download "TestDisk Download").


For more safety, PhotoRec uses read-only access to handle the drive or memory card you are about to recover lost data from. Important: As soon as a picture or file is accidentally deleted, or you discover any missing, do NOT save any more pictures or files to that memory device or hard disk drive; otherwise you may overwrite your lost data. This means that while using PhotoRec, you must not choose to write the recovered files to the same partition they were stored on.


#### [Engauge Digitizer](https://markummitchell.github.io/engauge-digitizer/)


The Engauge Digitizer tool accepts image files (like PNG, JPEG and TIFF) containing graphs, and recovers the data points from those graphs. The resulting data points are usually used as input to other software applications. Conceptually, Engauge Digitizer is the opposite of a graphing tool that converts data points to graphs. The process is shown below - an image file is imported, digitized within Engauge, and exported as a table of numeric data to a text file.


#### [Catfish (Linux only)](http://www.twotoasts.de/index.php/catfish/)

Rescuezilla is an easy-to-use disk imaging application that's fully compatible with Clonezilla — the industry-standard trusted by tens of millions.


Yes, Rescuezilla is the Clonezilla GUI (graphical user interface) that you might have been looking for.


Disk imaging makes a backup of your computer's hard drive which is managed as files stored on an external hard drive. If your hard drive fails, you can restore your disk image and within a few minutes all your documents and settings will be restored to the exact same state they were in when the last snapshot was taken.


Rescuezilla lets you perform backup, restore and recovery actions, even if you aren't able to boot into your regular operating system. It does not matter if you use Windows, Mac or Linux. It doesn't matter if you can't even login. Download and write the ISO to a USB stick, and reboot your machine. Your computer will load a complete mini operating system with a point-and-click user interface into your computer's memory without writing any information to your hard drive.

The notes can be [synchronised](https://joplin.cozic.net/#synchronisation) with various cloud services including [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV or the file system (for example with a network directory). When synchronising the notes, notebooks, tags and other metadata are saved to plain text files which can be easily inspected, backed up and moved around.


The application is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. A [Web Clipper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/joplin-web-clipper/), to save web pages and screenshots from your browser, is also available for Firefox.


An interesting alternative to Joplin written using the Qt framework is [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/).


#### [MindForger](https://www.mindforger.com/)


MindForger is human mind inspired personal knowledge management tool. The best note-taking and knowledge gathering tool available. 


MindForger aims to mimic human mind - learning, recalling, recognition, associations, forgetting - in order to achieve synergy with your mind to make your searching, reading and writing more productive.


MindForger starts where editors and search engines end. It thinks as you search, browse, read and write. Once you find a remark, MindForger brings its associations. As you browse notes and read them it looks up related relevant knowledge in your notebooks. If you edit a remark, MindForger brings associations as you write. It reminds you about existing content related to the text being written.


Currently it lacks a web clipper, it has also some bugs to be sorted out. After those will be taken care of it will be my preferred tool over Joplin mentioned above.


**Note for Windows users**: consider changing UI theme to native (under Mind -> Adapt), otherwise it may look a bit out of place as it was originally developed as a Linux application.

* [Notifications](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Notifications "Features") - Artha can show passive notifications (balloon tips) instead of the application's window popping up, so that you can continue what you were doing, uninterrupted. (like reading, writing, etc.)
* [Suggestions](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Suggestions "Features") - When a misspelled word is queried for, Artha gives you its near-match suggestions.
* [Relative to Sense Mapping](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Relative_to_Sense_Mapping "Features") - Relative words like synonyms, antonyms, etc. that are displayed are many. You might not know to which sense/definition of a word does a relative map to. In Artha, when you select a relative, its corresponding definition is scrolled to and highlighted for easy comprehension.


For a given word, the possible relatives shown by Artha includes [Synonyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Synonyms "Features"), [Antonyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Antonyms "Features"), [Derivatives](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Derivatives "Features"), [Pertainyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Pertainyms "Features") (Related Noun/Verb), [Attributes](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Attributes "Features"), [Similar Terms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Similar_Terms "Features"), [Domain Terms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Domain_Terms "Features"), [Entails](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Entails "Features") (what verb entails doing), [Causes](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Causes "Features") (what a verb causes to), [Hypernyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Hypernyms "Features") (is a kind of), [Hyponyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Hyponyms "Features") (kinds), [Holonyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Holonyms "Features") (is a part of) and [Meronyms](http://artha.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Features#Meronyms "Features") (parts). To know more about each category of relatives, click on it for an explanation and example. Once launched, Artha sits on the system tray and looks for the pre-set hot key combination press. You can select some text on any window, and call Artha by pressing the key combo. Depending upon the option set, Artha with either pop-up with the word looked-up or will show a passive notification of the most important definition of the searched term, from the system tray.

By the time it gets to the viewer, the content has been "stepped on" so many times that it is nearly unwatchable. Leonflix's novelty is that it extracts only the desired content that streaming sites provide, filtering out all the pop-ups and adware that have been cut into the product.

You can also use it in full CLI mode (Command Line Interface) on your NAS, Raspberry Pi or anywhere you want really, as long as you have a working Python interpreter.


The subtitles search is done by precisly identifying your video files by computing unique movie hash sums. This way, you have more chance to find the exact subtitles for your videos, avoiding synchronization problems between the subtitles and the soundtrack. But what if that doesn't work? Well, a search with the filename will be performed, but be aware: results are a bit more... unpredictable (don't worry, you will be warned! and you can even disable this feature if you want).

The two endpoints are identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine.


The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use and do not need to be memorized.

#### [MAT2: Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2)


mat2 is a metadata removal tool, supporting a wide range of commonly used file formats, written in python3: at its core, it's a library, used by an eponymous command-line interface, and a nautilus extension.


Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the data that are being documented.


Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company information to documents and spreadsheets. Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.


This is precisely the job of MAT2: getting rid, as much as possible, of metadata.
