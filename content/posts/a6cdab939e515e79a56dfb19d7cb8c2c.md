DAX Resources
-------------


So you’re ready to take your DAX skills to the next level? Fantastic. DAX stands for **Data Analysis Expressions**, it’s a formula language that you can use to create calculations and queries in Power BI. 


DAX is a powerful language that allows you to create complex calculations and analyze your data in ways you may have only dreamt of before. The language may not feel intuitive at first. 


Many users struggle in the beginning because the language is hard to grasp without theory. For that reason, you may find yourself looking for quality resources to learn DAX online. Well, this section has got you covered!


### DAX: Books


Mastering DAX requires experience, but to get started, I recommend reading the theory of different concepts in DAX. Below, you can find the best books on DAX that will provide you with structured content to take you from beginner to advanced DAX programmer.

Summary
-------


And that rounds up my **best training resources for Power BI**. As this article showed, there is an enormous amount of content available, and it can be overwhelming. My advice would be to pick a topic you want to improve on and have a look at which of the authors appeals to you. 


You can pick and choose whether you prefer written content online or in book form. Perhaps you prefer videos. And if neither of these fits your needs, you could always look into purchasing a structured paid course. Whatever your preference, I hope this article sent you in the right direction.


Did I miss an important resource? Let me know in the comments so we can keep this page up to date. 


Happy learning!
