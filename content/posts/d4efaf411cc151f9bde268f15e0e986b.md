The R Graph Gallery
===================




---


  

  
  


 Welcome the R graph gallery, a collection of charts made with the
 [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). Hundreds of charts are displayed in several sections, always with
 their reproducible code available. The gallery makes a focus on the
 tidyverse and [ggplot2](ggplot2-package.html). Feel free to
 suggest a chart or
 [report a bug](https://github.com/holtzy/R-graph-gallery);
 any feedback is highly welcome! Stay in touch with the gallery by
 following it on
 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/R_Graph_Gallery). Oh and if
 you want to get better at R,

 and subscribe to the newsletter.
 


  




The Largest Collection of R Chart Examples
------------------------------------------




---



 The R Graph Gallery boasts the
 **most extensive compilation of R-generated graphs** on the web.
 



 Featuring over **400 examples**, our collection is meticulously
 organized into nearly **50 chart types**, following the
 [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) classification.
 Each example comes with reproducible code and a detailed explanation
 of its functionality.
 



 We begin each chart type with a **foundational tutorial** that
 outlines its core structure and purpose. Once you've grasped the
 basics, our **step-by-step guides** offer insights into elementary
 customizations. This ensures that your charts not only visualize data
 effectively but also resonate with your unique requirements.
