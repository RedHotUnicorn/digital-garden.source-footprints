The open source Observable Framework uses a file-based workflow. Code in your preferred editor and check everything into git. You can even develop and preview offline.

[Read the Framework docs](/framework)Load and transform your data in Python, SQL, R, and more. Then tap into the full capabilities of the browser to display data with JavaScript in the client. Itâ€™s the best of all worlds.

Slow queries and timeouts are the bane of dashboard viewers. Observable takes snapshots of data during build so dashboards load instantly. Say goodbye to spinners.

Bring CI/CD to your dashboards and data apps. Test before you ship, use automatic deploy-on-commit, and ensure displays of data are always up-to-date. Self-manage scheduled builds and deploy to Observable or self-host.
