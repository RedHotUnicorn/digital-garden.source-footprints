Follow up
on time, every time
-----------------------------

Never drop the ball again

You're sending a crucial email: closing a deal, delegating a task, or landing a meeting. But people are busy — you might not hear back. So what do you do? You could painstakingly maintain a list or spreadsheet. Or you could somehow try to keep it all in your head.  


Superhuman makes it fast and easy. When you send an email, just choose a time — for example, 2 days. If you don't hear back by then, we'll remind you to follow up. You'll follow up on time, every time.

Type less and
accelerate your team
----------------------------------

Automate phrases and entire emails

No matter how fast we are, we all hit the same limit: the sheer time it takes to type.  


With Snippets, you can automate typing and push past this limit. Insert phrases, paragraphs, or whole emails. You can even include attachments, add people to CC, or BCC internal systems.  


You can also share Snippets with your team. Share common responses, recurring emails, and the most effective outreach. Your team will move faster, with consistent, up-to-date, and high-performing messaging.

See when people read your email
-------------------------------

Respond with brilliant timing

In Superhuman, you can see when people read your email and on which device.  


If someone doesn't reply, read statuses can show why. Maybe they never opened your email. Or perhaps they did, but on their phone. Now you can follow up with just the right message.  


Use read statuses to close high-value deals, hire elusive candidates, and work more effectively with your team.

Share read statuses
across your team
------------------------------------

Communicate and collaborate more effectively

In Superhuman, read statuses are shared across your team.  


Let's say a teammate sends an email and CCs you. Even though you did not send the email, you can still see when people read that email.  


Use team read statuses to handoff work, communicate better, and collaborate more effectively.

Avoid collisions
with your team
-------------------------------

See when your team is replying

Imagine the scene: you and your team get an urgent email, so you rapidly reply. But just after you hit send, your team replies as well.  In the best case, you look disorganized. In the worst case, you contradict each other.   


In Superhuman, you can see exactly when your team is replying. Know when your team is on it, avoid double work, and eliminate embarrassing collisions.

Check your calendar
without losing flow
---------------------------------------

We'll even update your email for you

When you have a busy schedule, you can't waste time looking it up.  


Whenever you suggest a date, we'll show your calendar for that day. Looking busy? Just hit a shortcut, and we'll show the next day. We'll even update your email automatically, so you don't have to.

Schedule events
right from your email
-------------------------------------

Instantly see when your team is free

You can create calendar events right from Superhuman.  


We could've built a point 'n' click form, as in Gmail or Outlook. But that wouldn't feel fun or be fast. That wouldn't be Superhuman.  


Instead, we rebuilt the experience to be keyboard-driven, blazingly fast, and surprisingly fun. Now you can schedule at the speed of thought.
