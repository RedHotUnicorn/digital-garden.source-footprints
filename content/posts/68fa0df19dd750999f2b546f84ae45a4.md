Currently, only three options are available in `folderv`: [target](#target), [sort](#sort), and [filter](#filter), which are specified in [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)


Here is an example of valid options:



```
```folderv
target: MyFolder
sort: create-new
filter: "*.mp4"
```

```

target
------


In folder note, this field can be omitted and the linked folder will be used by default.


If you use `folderv` in regular notes, `target` is required, and the given target path should be absolute (in vault). For example, for a note `folderA/note.md` to get `folderv` of `folderA/folderB/folderC`, target should be set to `folderA/folderB/folderC`, not relative path `folderB/folderC`


sort
----


There are six sort methods available:




| Option | Sort By |
| --- | --- |
| `name-az` | File name (A to Z) |
| `name-za` | File name (Z to A) |
| `modify-new` | Modified time (new to old) |
| `modify-old` | Modified time (old to new) |
| `create-new` | Created time (new to old) |
| `create-old` | Created time (old to new) |


filter
------


filter can be used to filter filename (including extionsion) using [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) and [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)


* glob: `filter: "*.md"`
* regex: `filter: /\.md$/`
