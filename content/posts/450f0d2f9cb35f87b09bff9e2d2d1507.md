```
Am                                Em
Do you still remember how we used to be 
F                          
Feeling together believe in 
             C
Whatever my love has said to me
Am                                      Em
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
F                                         
Felt like my savior, my spirit I gave you,  
        C
We’d only just begun

Chorus:
Am      Em      F        C
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Am                      Em           F                 C
Viva forever, I’ll be waiting,  everlasting like the sun
Am                      Em           F                 C
Live forever, For the moment, ever searching for the one… 

Am                             Em 
Yes I still remember every whispered word 
      F     
The touch of your skin, giving life from within 
        C
Like a love song never heard
Am                            Em
Slipping through our fingers like the sands of time
 F                                    C
Promises made every memory saved as reflections in my mind……

Chorus:
Am      Em      F        C
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Am                      Em           F                 C
Viva forever, I’ll be waiting,  everlasting like the sun
Am                      Em           F                 C
Live forever, For the moment, ever searching for the one… 

Am                       Em
Back were I belong now, was it just a dream 
F                                                 C                 
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold and the secrets safe with me

Chorus:
Am      Em      F        C
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Am                      Em           F                 C
Viva forever, I’ll be waiting,  everlasting like the sun
Am                      Em           F                 C
Live forever, For the moment, ever searching for the one…
