* Introduction
Version: 1.6Declarative Visualization in Power BI
=====================================


Deneb is a [certified custom visual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712) for [Microsoft Power BI](https://www.powerbi.com), which allows developers to use the declarative [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) syntax of the [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) or [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) languages to create their own data visualizations.


This is similar to the approaches used for creating [R](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-r-visuals?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712) and [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-python-visuals?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712) visuals in Power BI, with the following additional benefits:


* Libraries are packaged with the visual, so no additional dependencies on local libraries or gateways for your end-users when publishing reports.
* Specifications are rendered inside the Power BI client, rather than being delegated to another location, typically resulting in faster render times for end-users.
* Built for the web, meaning that it's possible to integrate with Power BI's interactivity features, with some additional setup.


#### Starting Out?[â€‹](#starting-out "Direct link to Starting Out?")


* Deneb is [available in AppSource](https://deneb.link/appsource?source=website&mktcmpid=homepage), and this is the most straightforward way of getting started and staying up-to-date with the latest versions.
