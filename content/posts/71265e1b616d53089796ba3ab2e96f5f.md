INTRODUCTION
------------

Networks are everywhere, but few people have learned how to see them or understand them. Whenever things connect to one another Networks are formed. People talk to people, businesses trade with businesses, and machines connect to machines: all of these create networks.

The [Social Media Research Foundation](https://www.smrfoundation.org/) is the home of the network analysis tool NodeXL and is supported by a global network of academics from a wide variety of disciplines.

NodeXL-Pro adds menus and features to Excel to simplify the tasks of getting network data, storing it, analyzing and visualizing it, and generating reports that share insights into connected structures.

NodeXL-Pro supports all features to conduct professional social network analysis (SNA): Community clustering, influencer detection, content analysis, sentiment analysis, time series analysis and a lot more.

> A growing number of academics, market strategists and social media managers from around the world make use of this easy-to-handle tool.

**What can I do with NodeXL?**
------------------------------

With NodeXL you can collect, analyze, and visualize complex social networks with NodeXL-integrated importers as *Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, Reddit* and *Flickr,* but also you can generate networks with external data, just have to download the data from other source and prepare the data.

Let´s see more about this NodeXL-integrated importers!

1.-Twitter Importer
===================

A) Twitter Network Data (for paid API user)
-------------------------------------------

Given the recent changes in [*access rules*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/2023/04/04/twitter-api-closed-nodexl-responses/) for the Twitter API, the NodeXL team has implemented two importer for data sets created by [*TweetBinder*](http://tweetbinder.com/) and [*BrandWatch*](http://brandwatch.com/). These commercial service provides access to Twitter data along with other platform data sources.

The following illustration shows how to generate a Twitter network with NodeXL using the commercial services of *TweetBinder* and *BrandWatch.*

Learn more [*here*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/2023/05/05/nodexl-pro-adds-import-from-tweetbinder/) *&* [*here*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/2023/05/05/nodexl-pro-adds-import-from-brandwatch/)*.*

B) X (formerly Twitter) Networks
--------------------------------

The new **X (Twitter) Search Network Data Importer** ([released August 2023](https://www.smrfoundation.org/2023/08/17/nodexl-pro-adds-import-from-xformerly-twitter/)) in **NodeXL Pro** collects posts (tweets) via the official X (Twitter) Search. That means the entire history of posts (tweets) since 2006 is available from the search importer.

NodeXL users need to be logged into their own X (Twitter) account in order to get the data. Heavy usage of the importer bears the potential risk of a blocked account, so we recommend creating a research account before you get started. But so far we have no reports of blocked accounts.

**Recipes: automation of tasks**
--------------------------------

The most powerful feature of NodeXL Pro is the task automation. NodeXL provides users with a set of files called: “data recipes” that help to automate all the NodeXL tasks required to perform large-scale social networking and content analysis. Learn more about data recipes [*here*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/automation/)*.*

How do I read a Twitter social media network map?
-------------------------------------------------

Conversations on Twitter create networks with identifiable contours as people reply to and mention one another in their tweets. These conversational structures differ, depending on the subject and the people driving the conversation.

Six structures are regularly observed: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, and inward and outward hub and spoke structures. These are created as individuals choose whom to reply to or mention in their Twitter messages and the structures tell a story about the nature of the conversation. Learn more about *conversational structures* [*here*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/)*.* The following example shows how to read a *Polarized Network* made with NodeXL-Pro.

**2.-Flickr Network**
=====================

Flickr is a media platform used for uploading, organizing, and sharing digital media such as photos and videos.

With NodeXL Flickr importer you can generate *Flickr Tag Network* and *Flickr User Network* using this [recipes](https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/automation/flickr-data-recipes/?fbclid=IwAR2J5gAUihb4FObJZS9ZIvagPGMYyEB9_mE7ndKywNR4GQOIT9mu9t__s70) for automate your tasks.

3.-Wikipedia Networks
=====================

Based on API tools available through MediaWiki, NodeXL Pro provides options to download relationships between networks and editors centered on a specific page within any MediaWiki domain.

The following illustration shows how to generate networks of Wikipedia articles with NodeXL-Pro using the [*recipe*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/automation/wikipedia-data-recipes/?fbclid=IwAR1rYferndo_74w0VRxOjEGUB3n9TxkUhil7d-Lzv4Gt_InaFpF8efoCecE) *Wikipedia Page Network 01.*

4.-Video YouTube networks
=========================

YouTube’s rich collection of users, videos, comments, subscriptions, featured channels, tags, ratings, and favorite videos offers multiple ways networks can be formed.

NodeXL Pro allows you to easily import and analyze *YouTube Video Recommendation Networks* as well as *User Comment Networks*.

The following illustration shows how to generate networks of YouTube with NodeXL-Pro using the [*recipe*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/automation/youtube-data-recipes/) *YouTube Video Network 01*

5.- Reddit Networks
===================

The NodeXL team has recently added a social media network data importer for [Reddit](http://reddit.com/). All users of NodeXL should now find this importer in the NodeXL Pro > Data > Import Menu.


> Reddit data sets are very similar to Twitter in their wide range of topics, rapid message creation, large volumes of content and wide geographic coverage. As we see changes at Twitter that are likely to cause migration of users to other platforms, we imagine that platforms like Reddit are likely to grow in importance.

The following illustration shows how to generate Reddit Networks with NodeXL-Pro. Learn more [*here.*](https://www.smrfoundation.org/2023/05/05/nodexlproredditimporter/)

6.-WhatsApp Data Importer
=========================

Download the discussions in a WhatsApp chat group and turn it into a network.

[WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp) is a widely used personal messenger application owned by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/). WhatsApp allows people to form chats with one or more people. WhatsApp chats can grow to include large numbers of participants, effectively becoming semi-public group discussions. In some cases, these discussions can be the focus of [collective action with civic impact](https://theconnector.substack.com/p/whatsapp-and-the-micro-organizing).
