Obsidian File Color
===================

What is this?
-------------


This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which allows you to select colors for your files and folders in the file explorer.


Usage
-----


Setting the color for a file or folder is done by right clicking on the file in the file explorer and selecting `Set color`. This opens a modal where you can select all the colors defined in the plugin palette.

### Changing the palette


To add colors to the palette open the plugin settings, and click the `+` button. Then use the color picker to select the color, and input a name for the color. Afterwards it will appear in the `Set color` modal. You can add as many colors as you need.

### Options


* Cascade Colors: if turned on, colors on folders will cascade to their children. Set colors on children to override parents.
* Background Colors: if turned on, the background is colored instead of the text.


Compatibility
-------------


This plugin has been tested with a few other community plugins:


* [Icon Folder](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder)
	+ Should work out of the box, and colors should automatically be applied to the icons as well.
* [Folder Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core)
	+ Will also work out of the box, however the underlines added to the files will not be colored.
	+ Personally I use the following CSS snippet locally:
	
	
	
	```
	.nav-folder.alx-folder-with-note>.nav-folder-title>.nav-folder-title-content {
	  text-decoration-style: dotted;
	  text-decoration-color: inherit;
	}
	```
	
	Which will make make the underline use the colors defined by this plugin. The result looks something like this:
