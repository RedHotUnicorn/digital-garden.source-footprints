> I wasn't self-educated.


> I was community-educated.

My plan for this is to be a list of every article (or tool) that I've personally used to grow my knowledge from the community that I can easily point back to in conversation. This list will continue to grow. I promise you I wish I could read all of your articles and provide a TLDR context on everything that's out there but I'm sorry we've all got cats we would rather be at home playing with right now.
