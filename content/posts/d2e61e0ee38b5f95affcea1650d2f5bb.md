Happy Monday, fellow sprinters!

Today is the first day of a wonderful journey into the deeper parts of Logseq. Between now and the 31st of July, more than 150 of us will learn how to build time-saving workflows with Logseq queries.

To discover everything you need to know about this sprint, [read the introductory post on the forum.](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/sprint-with-us-and-learn-everything-about-queries-this-summer/8617) In a few minutes, you'll also receive via email the invites for the live sessions. Each week there will be one talk (on Wednesday and is recorded) and one open Q&A session (on Friday and is **not** recorded). 

This week, I kick off the series of live sessions by sharing my learning method. As preparation, [I've published three of my talks and notes about learning how to learn.](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/how-to-design-and-run-personal-learning-projects/8700) If you can, go through the materials before [Wednesday's live session](https://lu.ma/lls1wed), where I will share my specific approach to this learning challenge. And when you take notes, ***please share them** in a reply to the post*.

Speaking of the forum, I've created a dedicated section titled *[Learning Sprints](https://discuss.logseq.com/c/learning-sprints/19)*, where you can find the [query-specific sprint](https://discuss.logseq.com/c/learning-sprints/queries/20). I recommend you bookmark that subforum and return to it whenever you're stuck writing queries or want to share something. I also recommend you start a dedicated post (a "learn log") that you update throughout the sprint. [As an example, here's the start of my learn log.](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/learn-log-ramses-quest-to-grokking-logseqs-data-structure/8751)

If you have any questions, [please drop them in the forum](https://discuss.logseq.com/c/learning-sprints/queries/20). I hope to see many of you sprint together with me, and actively participate by posting your questions and insights.

With gratitude,
