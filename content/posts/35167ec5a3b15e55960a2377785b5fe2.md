How To Export Your Podcast Highlights To Obsidian
=================================================

Podcasts are one of the largest knowledge sources in the world. But discovering & extracting that knowledge has been quite cumbersome.

This is why we have built the [Snipd](https://www.snipd.com) podcast app to discover, highlight & share the best moments in podcasts and take notes from them in one click (see here: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.topicfinder.podcastdiscovery) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snipd-your-podcast-knowledge/id1557206126)).

Many of our listeners use a second brain app to organize the knowledge they gain from podcasts and connect it with their notes from other sources like books and blog posts. This is why we are building second brain integrations to make the export of podcast highlights as seamless as possible.

Obsidian Export Integration
===========================

![]()In the Snipd app, you can easily export your podcast highlights, which we call snips, to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), including:

* title
* automatically generated summary
* transcript
* private note
* shareable link to the original audio segment

![]()

An exported podcast highlight (=snip), viewed in Obsidian

Additionally, you can add metadata about the episode, including:

* show notes
* name of the host
* publish date
* podcast show name
* shareable link to the episode

And best of all, the metadata is formatted to be compatible with the popular community plugin [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and contains backlinks for the show name & host name.

**How To Export**
=================

1. Go to *‚ÄúYou‚Äù* ‚Üí *‚ÄúSettings‚Äù* ‚Üí *‚ÄúExport & sync‚Äù* ‚Üí *‚ÄúExport to Obsidian‚Äù*
2. Select the snips you want to export
3. Click *‚ÄúExport‚Äù &* open the resulting Markdown text in Obsidian

That‚Äôs it üôÇ

![]()**FYI for iOS users**:

On iOS, the Obsidian app does not show up in the iOS share menu yet. You can vote for this feature in the Obsidian forum [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/feature-ios-share-sheet-extension/14873). In the meantime, you can simply click on ‚Äúcopy‚Äù in the iOS share menu, open Obsidian, and paste.

Optionally, you can also create your own entry for the share menu with an iOS shortcut (see below for more info).

We‚Äôd Love To Hear What You Think
================================

We are still new to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) ourselves and are sure there are many ways to improve this export functionality.

Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to us with your feedback. Use the in-app feedback button, send us an email to [hello@snipd.com](mailto:hello@snipd.com), or tag us on Twitter [@snipd\_app](https://twitter.com/snipd_app).
