There seems to be a problem with your extension. I cannot log in to my account, whether by email or Google. I ask you to urgently fix the defect as soon as possible, because I have become upset recently because of this problem. (Waiting for your reply)

Really good. But please enable "Auto theme with OS" by default. My poor eyes xD
About the extension: its the first I tried that lets me drag+drop my tabs into groups intuitively. Only started using this today but so far it seems pretty good.
