FAQ
---

What data do you store?We don't store any content from your apps. No messages, no documents, no files, no email, etc. The only things we store is the graph of connections between your assets. All content is delivered to you from APIs of the services you connected. 

Can anybody see anything?No. Teammates are only able to see those resources they have access in the apps these resources come from. Everybody can connect they private Slack or Teams channels, but the conversations from there are going to be accessible only for their participants.

Can people get access to restricted assets?Definitely not. Sense doesn't create any extra access levels for the connected apps. If user can't access an asset in an app, they will never be able to access this via Sense. 

How the assets get related?Â We use our special algorithms to find relationships for every asset across all the apps your team uses. For example two assets are going to be connect if one of them contains a link to another one. If a conversation contains a mention of the given document and another links, both of them:Â the link and the document are going to be connected as well as the conversation. There are many more ways of how we can securely assume some assets being connected, including Graph and Machine Learning algorithms.

Can I use Sense individually?Yes, you can. However Sense is the best to use for the case when you have tons of undiscovered and constantly growing mess, which is more relevant when you have multiple users in your Sense workspace.

Is there a Free trial period?Yes, we grant you 14-days Free Trial period. You can enjoy all Sense features without limits. Credit card is not required to start the Free Trial.
