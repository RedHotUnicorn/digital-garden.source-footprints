[![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*YVP6GRz4DfOWnv1Tc68JQw.jpeg)](/?source=post_page-----1f90ccf0ff79--------------------------------)7 min read·May 6, 2021--

This article lays out the Big Data journey for a fictitious online art marketplace — Celebrations using the Big Data storymap tool to help visualize the Big Data journey and help the organization understand the key components of Big Data Strategy.

Big Data storymap is a concept introduced by Bill Schmarzo. The author states “The goal of a storymap is to provide a graphical visualization that uses metaphors and themes to educate our clients about the key components of a successful big data strategy. And like any good map, there are important “landmarks” that I want to make sure you visit.”

**About Celebrations**

Celebrations is an online e-commerce marketplace to buy unique handcrafted products as well as vintage items from across the globe to support diverse artisans, crafters, and collectors. Celebrations value proposition is to nurture the entrepreneurial and creative spirit of artisans and provide a platform with a wide variety of products that are one-of-a-kind and attractive. Its business model is providing a low-cost subscription service for sellers and scaling business with repeat, habitual buyers that are looking to gift someone, style themselves, or celebrate events. Celebrations revenue stream is primarily derived from the commission earned on each sale transaction along with paid ads that sellers run.

Our key competitors include Etsy, Amazon Handmade, Shopify, Big Cartel, Artfire, Aftcra, and Indiemade. The goods on the platform are wearables, bath/beauty products, home decor, and food. Vintage items are defined as more than 20 years old. Our marketing channels include the platform and ancillary channels like partner websites, social media, in-house workshops, advertising on TV, and most importantly word of mouth.

Sellers sign up on the marketplace by paying a fee. This enables them to set up a shop within the platform. They can list as many products as they want and add tags so they can be searched more easily. Sellers can also pay for running paid-ads on the Celebrations platform, where they are charged for clicks.

Buyers can ask sellers questions before they make a purchase. Celebrations collects payment from buyers and transfers it to the seller’s account in the mode of payment they prefer. Additionally, buyers can share reviews and provide ratings for the products purchased.

**Following is Big Data Storymap for scaling Celebrations**

**Big Data River**

Celebrations Big Data River is deep and insightful, wide and diverse, fast and powerful. We will leverage artificial intelligence and agile approaches to expand our processes to capture and augment data. This includes structured, unstructured, real-time, near-time, batch processing data. We can mine social, mobile, point of sale, payments, shipping, inventory, merchants’ stores, blogs, discussion boards, online art forums, art newsletters, and external data sources.

**Traditional Town**

In the early beginnings, Celebrations has been operating using traditional data warehouse and business intelligence technologies. Our data warehouse architecture is not robust enough to handle the new age demands for mining vast growing volumes of data in real-time. This is an impediment to our vision to scale exponentially in the next three years and be the most preferred shopping destination. This significantly limits our ability to mine vast volumes of data, understand data correlations, overlay patterns, and integrate unstructured data into our internal data. We are unable to gain insights buried in social media reviews, partner website reviews and traffic data, support call notes, and consumer comments on our own website. Our analytics function is limited to operational aspects of our business. We do not have established ways to gain insights and integrate into our business practices, optimize processes, and for product/platform development. These limitations further prevent us from targeting new markets and new product development.
