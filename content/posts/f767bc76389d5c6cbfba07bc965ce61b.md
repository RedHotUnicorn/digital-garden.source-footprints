CommonMark
==========


A strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown
---------------------------------------------------------------




 It’s a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.
 



[Learn Markdown in 60 Seconds](//commonmark.org/help/)




 It was [developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#History). Gruber wrote the first markdown-to-html converter in Perl, and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages.
 



 John Gruber’s [canonical description of Markdown’s syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) does not specify the syntax unambiguously.
 



 In the absence of a spec, early implementers consulted the original `Markdown.pl` code to resolve these ambiguities. But `Markdown.pl` was quite buggy, and gave manifestly bad results in many cases, so it was not a satisfactory replacement for a spec. `Markdown.pl` was last updated December 17th, 2004.
 


 Because there is no unambiguous spec, implementations have diverged considerably over the last 10 years. As a result, users are often surprised to find that a document that renders one way on one system (say, a GitHub wiki) renders differently on another (say, converting to docbook using Pandoc). To make matters worse, because nothing in Markdown counts as a “syntax error,” the divergence often isn’t discovered right away.
 



 There’s no standard test suite for Markdown; [MDTest](https://github.com/michelf/mdtest/) is the closest thing we have. The only way to resolve Markdown ambiguities and inconsistencies is [Babelmark](https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/), which compares the output of 20+ implementations of Markdown against each other to see if a consensus emerges.
 



 We propose a **standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown**, along with a **suite of comprehensive tests** to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. We believe this is necessary, even essential, for the future of Markdown.
 



 That’s what we call **CommonMark**. [![](images/markdown-mark.png)](https://github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark)



We’re a group of Markdown fans continually working toward the vision of CommonMark — a standard, interoperable and testable version of Markdown.

We’re a group of Markdown fans who either work at companies with industrial scale deployments of Markdown, have written Markdown parsers, have extensive experience supporting Markdown with end users – or all of the above.

Exercise our [reference implementations](https://code.commonmark.org/), or [find a community implementation](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/List-of-CommonMark-Implementations) in your preferred environment or language. Provide 


If a CommonMark implementation does not already exist in your preferred environment or language, try **implementing your own CommonMark parser**. One of our major goals is to [strongly specify Markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/), and to eliminate the many old inconsistencies and ambiguities that made using Markdown so difficult. Did we succeed?


### [spec.commonmark.org](https://spec.commonmark.org/)



 The CommonMark specification.
 


### [code.commonmark.org](https://code.commonmark.org/)



 Reference implementation and validation test suite on GitHub.
 


### [talk.commonmark.org](https://talk.commonmark.org/)



 Public discussion area and mailing list via [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org).
 


### [commonmark.org/help](https://commonmark.org/help)

### [spec.commonmark.org/dingus/](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)



 Live testing tool powered by the reference implementation.
 



 The current version of the CommonMark spec is quite robust after many years of public feedback.
 



 There are currently CommonMark implementations for 
 [dozens of programming languages](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/List-of-CommonMark-Implementations), 
 and the following sites and projects have adopted CommonMark:
 

* Discourse
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Reddit
* Qt
* Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange
* Swift
