Premise
-------


Wunjo comes from the ancient runic alphabet and represents joy and contentment, which could tie into the idea of using the application to create engaging and expressive speech. Vunyo (ᚹ) is the eighth rune of the Elder and Anglo-Saxon Futhark. Prior to the introduction of the letter W into the Latin alphabet, the letter Ƿynn (Ƿƿ) was used instead in English, derived from this rune.


Credits
-------


Wunjo AI is built upon the remarkable work of various open-source projects. Each integrated component reflects a commitment to improving and adapting existing technologies within the collaborative landscape of open-source development.
