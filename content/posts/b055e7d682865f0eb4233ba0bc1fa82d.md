**ActivityWatch** is an app that automatically tracks how you spend time on your devices.


It is **open source**, **privacy-first**, **cross-platform**, and a great alternative to services like RescueTime, ManicTime, and WakaTime.


It can be used to keep track of your productivity, time spent on different projects, bad screen habits, or just to understand how you spend your time.

About the maintainers
---------------------



 ActivityWatch was founded by brothers and current maintainers Erik Bjäreholt and Johan Bjäreholt.
 We started building ActivityWatch because we thought something like it should exist (it didn't), so we decided to build it ourselves. You can read the [History](https://docs.activitywatch.net/en/latest/history.html) page in the docs for more about the project's origins.
 


We don't work on ActivityWatch full-time, so development may slow at times. But we think that ActivityWatch is important software (if you agree, [donate](/donate/)!), and we're building for the long term. 
 We want to build an as useful tool as possible for as many people as possible.
 



 Over the years, many significant contributions have come from the community, and we hope to see them increase over time.
