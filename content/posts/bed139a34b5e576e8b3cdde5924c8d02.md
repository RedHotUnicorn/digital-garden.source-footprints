| I have the same deal. git clone, git fetch etc., all get stuck during the ‚Äúresolving delta‚Äù step. It may be a completely different issue as I find that ish is incredibly slow these days. I could compile a project in 10 minutes , yet the same project took about 4 hours to compile today. This could be related to iOS 15. |

| Thanks [@saagarjha](https://github.com/saagarjha) for pointing to the thread. I noticed an 'Upgrade Repositories' notification in the Settings and it upgraded my git from 2.26.3-r0 to 2.32.0-r0 I did little tests and didn't notice any issue yet, I will use iSH & Obsidian more frequently to come to a conclusion though. In case, it occurs again, I will run `git config --global pack.threads "1"` as mentioned in the other thread to see if it resolves the issue. It seems to be working well for many. |

| Just to say I'm having the same issue on my iPad Model A1709 (iPad Pro 10.5in 1st gen), git 2.34.1-r0. I activated single-threading and that worked for a while resolving deltas. But now I'm stuck forever even at a `git commit`, while a `git add` can take up to a minute or more. |

| Confirming the same problem on iPad 12.9 inch (5th gen 2021) with iPadOS 15.3.1 and iSH 1.2.3 (build 298). `git add` or `git commit` stuck forever when underlying git repository resides on iPad file providers. Do not have the problem on iSH native file system. |

| It stopped working for me again, once my unstaged and untracked files went high in number. Although previously I mentioned it worked for me momentarily. For me git add itself stays stuck endlessly, the app kind of freezes that even ctrl+c doesn't work. |

| Instead of cloning on the URL (which defaults on main branch), I cloned on a second branch which is named DEV. `git clone -b <branchname> <remote-repo-url>` It finished without problem . Then I fetched from master branch and switch it to main branch, all work. So I deleted the Dev branch. Hope this can help. |

Thanks for sharing.  It only works in my iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 16.7) while iSH is not killed. Everytime I restart iSH, this issue will happen again. After reading this issue: [rsyncing into mount point from fileprovider doesn't quite work after iSH restart](https://github.com/ish-app/ish/issues/1581), I found a solution: mount again before handling git. |
