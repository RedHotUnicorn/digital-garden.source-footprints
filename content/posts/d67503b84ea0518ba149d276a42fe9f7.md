In its most basic definition, unstructured data simply means any form of data that does not easily fit into a relational model or a set of database tables. Unstructured data exists in a variety of formats: books, audio, video, or even a collection of documents. In fact, some of this data may very well contain a measure of structure, such as chapters within a novel or the markup on a HTML Web page, but not a full data model typical of relational databases.
