VSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft’s editor VS Code.

Why Does This Exist
-------------------


Microsoft’s `vscode` source code is open source (MIT-licensed), but the product available for download (Visual Studio Code) is licensed under [this not-FLOSS license](https://code.visualstudio.com/license) and contains telemetry/tracking. According to [this comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005) from a Visual Studio Code maintainer:



> When we [Microsoft] build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.
> 
> 
> When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a “clean” build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license


The VSCodium project exists so that you don’t have to download+build from source. This project includes special build scripts that clone Microsoft’s vscode repo, run the build commands, and upload the resulting binaries for you to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases). **These binaries are licensed under the MIT license. Telemetry is disabled.**


If you want to build from source yourself, head over to [Microsoft’s vscode repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) and follow their [instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run). VSCodium exists to make it easier to get the latest version of MIT-licensed VS Code.
