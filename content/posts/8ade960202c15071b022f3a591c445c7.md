Exploring works of art has never been this up close and personal. Boulevard AR brings art to you, wherever you are, and now features three important paintings from Londonâs National Portrait Gallery collection. Representing 20th-century Nobel-Prize winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, renowned 19th-century painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti, alongside his friend, the critic and novelist Theodore Watts-Dunton, and lastly Sir Henry Unton, a diplomat and soldier from the Elizabethan era, Boulevard ARâs offerings reveal secrets and tell stories across a 400-year span.
