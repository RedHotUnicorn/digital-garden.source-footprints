I have an Obsidian vault in GitHub version control but whenever I navigate from one note to another in the Obsidian UI the note I left registers as being changed in GitHub desktop but no content changes are found. This only occurs on one of the machines I cloned the repository to so I’m wondering if it is an Obsidian configuration difference between the vault on each machine.


My expectation is that looking at a note without editing the text would not result in changes being logged by GitHub desktop.


For reference my .gitIgnore file is as follows:



```
.vscode/settings.json
.obsidian/
.trash/
.DS_Store

```

The first line is present because I’m using MK Docs to publish part of the vault online: [GitHub - jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs: A Template to Publish Obsidian/Foam Notes on Github Pages (uses MkDocs)](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs)



Assuming the .gitignore file is ok for Obsidian settings I don’t think the first line is relevant.

Any suggestions about where to look would be appreciated.

After looking into this further I believe the issue related to line endings in my local repository. I’m working on Windows. The issue only seems to arises in vaults where my line-endings are `CRLF`. I check that by running the command `git ls-files --eol` in tracked folders. Folders with `LF` line endings work fine. At present I’m unsure how the issue arose or how to resolve it locally and then sync the changes.

I ran into a similar issue where I sync a vault between Mac and Windows machines, but I was able to work around it by disabling the autocrlf conversion on my *windows machine only*. So my .git/config file has this:



```
[core]
	autocrlf = false

```
