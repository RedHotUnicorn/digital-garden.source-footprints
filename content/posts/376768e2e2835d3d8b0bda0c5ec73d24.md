Imagine the pages as nodes organized on a circle:

The `[[references]]` are links (arrows with a direction). This is a **graph/network** and it can be displayed in *Graph View*:


![](https://discuss.logseq.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/966c74da7827866d1fc5120e72d7ef86e1bcc174.png)




---


Each page has a **tree** of blocks:


![](https://discuss.logseq.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ab52f613b7c89fa32107ee52ace8baf64003de56.png)




---


The `[[references]]` are links that actually start from a *block* and target a *page*.


![](https://discuss.logseq.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/924457ba04bd9e7769a37bb9a5bbf11f69c073a9.png)


Imagine that the circle represents a room, the “hall of pages”. The pages are doors and the links can be represented as people entering the room from one door and exiting from another. The *Graph View* available in Logseq displays the paths they took in the hall of pages, with no information of blocks that are behind each door.


In a geometric sense, the connections you see in *Graph View* are the projections of the actual links that go from *blocks* to *pages*. If you are not familiar with a projection, think of it as a shadow:


The *page references* can be traversed in the opposite direction thanks to the section *Linked references* available at the bottom of each page.




---


Instead a connection between *pages* can be made using *Page properties*. A special property is *Tags*, because the same link can be traversed in the reverse direction thanks to a section that appears at the bottom of pages, named *“Pages tagged with (current page)”*.




---


In general, *properties* have a *key::* and a *value*, so basically those links are *triples* like *subject* + *verb* + *object*. Compared to the previous links (those made with `[[references]]` from a block to a page), these links made with *properties* are relations **with a name**.


![](https://discuss.logseq.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/114478bbfa8119007a4551a176a692a122d946f8.png)


Even if you, as a user, can’t see it, everything in Logseq is stored as *triples* in a so called *graph database*. Then Logseq UI displays only a small portion of that graph i.e. the one where *nodes* are *pages* and the *links* are the `[[references]]`.




---


Since blocks can have *properties* too, it is possible to turn a normal `[[reference]]` in one where the name of the relation is specified. For example, a block could represent a book, a page an author and the *property* `author::` their relation:




---


It is also possible to use *block references* as *values* of *properties*. Since *pages* are not involved, no connection is displayed in *Graph view*. In the example below, the pages *Books* and *Authors* gather all books and authors (maybe organized in a hierarchy of blocks) and the *property* `author::` links them:


The image above also represent the same link traversed in the opposite direction thanks to the button that appears at the right of a block when it has been referenced somewhere else. In the example above it let you see all the books by an author and where that author is mentioned in general. This feature is available in latest Logseq release (0.8.18) thanks to [this change](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/8695) by [@cldwalker](/u/cldwalker) (many thanks!).


It’s up to the user to choose what should be a page and what a block. Using *queries* it is possible to retrieve content using both *page references* and *block references*. It is also possible to specify the name of the relation in case *properties* were used and even retrieve everything that has a given *property key* like `author::`.

If I follow the instructions then after opening the file nothing happens.

If you mean the Tldraw file, maybe the file open but it is zoomed too much on a white area? In that case you need to zoom out. For the rest it works as expected for me ![](https://discuss.logseq.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Is this still the case? Or has this UI element been deprecated? I am not seeing such a segment when I click on a `tag::` value in Logseq version 0.9.19.

Have you tried `tags::` instead of `tag::`?

Yeah, I am using `tags::` in my book notes.



Here are some screenshots illustrating my point:

Here’s how I do my book notes. Notice the `tags::` property down there. It is a “page property” as far as I understand the concept.  




Here’s what I see when I click on the `econ` tag. There are no “Pages tagged with” segment, down below the page.

No, you are using block properties. Page properties must be placed in the first top-level block.

The `## Meta` header is the first top-level block. Am I missing something?

That `# Meta` turned it into a regular block. You have to place only properties in the first top-level block.

I didn’t know that! I should fix this with my notes, going back to my 10-or-so pages that I already have this error…

Wait… Even though you say I have turned it into a regular block, I can see those property values under “Page Property” filter in a query builder:


How about that? It seems like even though I have the `## Meta` in the first block of a page, and under it I have listed some properties, they are still listed as “Page Properties” when I select /Query → Page → property , and then visiually inspect the available options.

Yeah, this is weird in logseq’s behavior. There is a lot to it in unexplained, undocumented behavior that the user is not being hand-held through a showcase or something. Now I am getting nuanced behavior of some types of page properties, and block properties, when they are formatted differently.

You have properties, when they are alone in the first top-level block they refer to the page, otherwise to the block. Once you have defined a property key it doesn’t matter if it was mentioned as page or block property.


The documentation says:
