Organize your files
===================

**File naming and folder hierarchy**
------------------------------------


Keeping track of research data and documentation is critical. Strategies include:


* Spend time planning out both folder hierarchy and file naming conventions in the beginning of a project. Consider how you or others will look for and access files at a later date. Do you think about them by type, location, study or something else?
* Establish a folder hierarchy that aligns with the project. Example: [Project] / [Experiment] / [Instrument or Type of file]
* Consider all aspects of the project and develop a file naming scheme that includes important metadata. Example: [Date]\_[Run]\_[SampleType]
* Consider sorting when deciding what element of the file name will go first. File names starting with YYYYMM will sort differently than files starting with the MMDDYYYY format.
* Provide a method for easy adoption. Consider a shared dropbox with the folder hierarchy in place and a readme file in onboarding documentation for new contributors.
* Check for established file naming conventions. Many disciplines have recommendations, for example: [DOEâ€™s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program](https://www.arm.gov/guidance/datause/formatting-and-file-naming-protocols).
