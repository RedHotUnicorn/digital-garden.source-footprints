# Description 
#leverage #prioritization
Have you been buying Bitcoin since the early days? 
Did you ride the Gamestop wave to its highs?
Or do you remember epic collapse of Enron stock?
In every instance, the end result was a concentrated (or un-diversified) portfolio. Which can put you at tremendous risk.

We can take the same approach to $10/hour and $10,000/hour work. How can we build a balanced portfolio of work? Let's extend the analogy:

$10/hr work = cash. It's liquid, moves quickly, "safe" and allows you to function on a daily basis.

$100/hr work = bonds. There's a (tiny) bit of passive income that works while you sleep. But it's not enough to move the needle in your long-term life.

$1,000/hr work = stocks. This is a sweet spot. You get price appreciation AND dividends if you are able to play the long game. Owning stocks over decades will almost guarantee you grow your wealth. And we could stop here.

$10,000/r work = crypto or angel investing. Here you have the potential for spectacular returns, tons of leverage, but at a high risk. You won't know for years (possibly decades) if you were right. It could all go to zero. There's a tremendous amount of path dependency, randomness and luck.

Now, like investing, consider two variables as you build your own portfolio: age and risk tolerance. 

You can quickly see the danger in owning the bookends (Cash only or Crypto only). Likewise, if you only did $10/hr work you'd be the "world's best execution machine." If you only did $10,000/hr work you'd be "a dreamer who can't get anything done."

As you advance in your career, you'll build up the experience, credibility and cushion to do more $1,000 and $10k work. Conversely, a college grad will be mostly focused on execution and blocking and tackling. But regardless of your age and experience, it's critical to sprinkle some $10k pixie dust into your daily activities. Even if it's just 10 minutes.

After all, what's the point if we don't dream a little bit?

 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xr_Dqls3P8&t=0)~~  were you one of those president investors who bought bitcoin in the early days or did you join your fellow redditors and ride that gainstop wave now you've got a first class problem a heavily concentrated portfolio but like the wu tank financial says in the chappelle show y'all need to diversify your portfolios now we can take this approach and apply it to 10k work i often get the question from people early in their careers how can i do more of that 10k work i'm stuck on the 10 and 100 dollar work let's dig in let's start by recapping the framework on the y-axis you have low and high leverage the x-axis low-skill high skill and you move from quadrant 10 all the way to the 10 000 quadrant now in our portfolio analogy 10 work is like cash it's liquid it's fast you need it but you're never going to grow wealth with it alone 100 work is like bonds there's a little bit of passive income but again it's so paltry that you're not going to move the needle on your wealth or impact now you get into the sweet spot thousand dollar work that's like owning 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xr_Dqls3P8&t=67)~~  equities equities have growth potential they pay dividends they will get price appreciation over the long term a great great place to be just like a thousand dollar work and finally 10k is like angel investing or bitcoin very very high leverage potential for incredible returns but you could never put all of your wealth into crypto or angel investments now as you design your work portfolio consider two variables first where you are in your career second what's your risk tolerance now if you're more experienced you have savings you might lean more towards 1000 and 10k work you can afford to take that risk if you're earlier in your career a new college grad you're building up your work portfolio blocking and tackling with that 10 and 100 but remember always sprinkle in a little bit of that 10k pixie dust
