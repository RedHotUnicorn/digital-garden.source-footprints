With Logseq's user base growing and several old features being updated or new features being introduced, I feel like the Logseq help documentation could do with a little love.

The current [Official Logseq Documentation](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/contents) is good, but I feel that having it written within Logseq is a little confusing and can sometimes be overwhelming. For this reason, I have taken the great work done by those before me and represented / amended / added to their work in what is hopefully easier to read and more digestible Logseq Tips and Tricks.

The purpose of this guide is not (at least for now) to be a getting started step-by-step walkthrough but more as a place for you to find snippets of information on particular feature / tips and tricks. This is a work in process and will be updated as and when possible. 

The current flow of the Unofficial Logseq Documentation is:

1. Very brief [Getting Started](/unofficial-logseq-docs/general/getting-started) guide
2. [Beginner to Intermediate](https://app.gitbook.com/o/kne1yGuUlhT5Vbgrzh7V/s/55IaNCbMPJqTajfUYNlX/~/changes/AzQm99u6FidyxWZt4I3k/beginner-to-advance-features) Features
3. [Intermediate to Advance](https://app.gitbook.com/o/kne1yGuUlhT5Vbgrzh7V/s/55IaNCbMPJqTajfUYNlX/~/changes/AzQm99u6FidyxWZt4I3k/intermediate-to-advance-features) Features
4. [Queries](https://app.gitbook.com/o/kne1yGuUlhT5Vbgrzh7V/s/55IaNCbMPJqTajfUYNlX/~/changes/AzQm99u6FidyxWZt4I3k/queries)

I am not wedded to the above, it was simply a means to getting some content on the page. If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute, please feel more than welcome to do so (I will try to work out how this is done and include instructions).
