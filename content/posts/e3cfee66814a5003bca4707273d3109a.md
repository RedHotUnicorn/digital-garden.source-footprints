Version 0.9.2
Data Design Language
====================


This site presents the underlying principles, design system and chart components of the Data
 Design Language for data.who.int.
 
The **WHO Data Design Language** (DDL) provides building blocks and techniques for
 creating rich information experiences for everyone.
 


Our objective is to ensure that a user's experience of our data presentation is as
 informative, equitable, accessible and delightful as possible.
 


Deliberately not designed as a rule set, but rather a toolbox, the DDL includes a chart
 library, design guidelines, colour and typographic style specifications with usability
 guidance for internationalization (i18n) and accessibility (a11y), all reflecting our data
 design principles â ready to use and apply in a variety of settings and environments.

They reveal uncertainty, precision, provenance, and coverage of the data.


### Open


We create rich data experiences for everyone, through accessible, international,
 adaptable, and participatory approaches to data visualization.
 


### Robust


Data can be consumed in a variety of channels and sizes, through robust and lean
 technological solutions.
 


### Principles


Our data design principles present guiding standards for how we approach the design of
 data presentation at WHO.
