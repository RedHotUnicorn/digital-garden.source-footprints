Pandas Tutor visualizes how Python code transforms dataframes
=============================================================

[**Pandas Tutor**](vis.html) lets you write Python [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) code in your browser
and see how it transforms your data step-by-step. (If you use R, try [Tidy Data Tutor](https://tidydatatutor.com/). To visualize general Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript code, try [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/).)

**Why use this tool?** Let's say you're trying to explain what this
`pandas` code does:





```

(dogs[dogs['size'] == 'medium']
 .sort_values('type')
 .groupby('type').median()
)

```

Running this code in Jupyter shows only the input data and final result:

But this doesn't tell you what's going on behind the scenes.



* **What did this code just do?**
 This single code expression has 4 steps (filtering, sorting, grouping, and
 aggregating), but only the final output is shown.
* **Where were the medium-sized dogs?**
 This code filters for dogs with size `"medium"`, but none of
 those dogs appear in the original table display (on the left) because they were buried in
 the middle rows.
* **How were the rows grouped?**
 The output doesn't show which rows were grouped and aggregated together.
 (Note that printing a `pandas.GroupBy` object won't display this
 information either.)




If you **[ran this same
code](vis.html#trace=example-code/py_dogs.json)** in Pandas Tutor, you can teach students exactly what's going
on step-by-step:

Or if you're a student, you can use this tool to explore and learn on your
own. Check out more examples below:
