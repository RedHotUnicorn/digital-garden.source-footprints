Optimize Canvas Connections
===========================


Suppose you start a canvas.

Then you move everything around while you brainstorm. The connections between notes may quickly become a mess.

This simple plugin automatically reconnect notes together, using their nearest edges.


Select the notes to reconnect, then run command:


`Optimize Canvas Connections: Optimize selection (preserve axes)`


or


`Optimize Canvas Connections: Optimize selection (shortest path)`

Shortest path
-------------


The `shortest path` option reconnects notes using their nearest edges, always using the shortest path possible. This is the most drastic approach.


Preserve axes
-------------


The `preserve axes` option also reconnects notes using their nearest edges, but it respects the axes on which a connection originally begins and ends. For instance, a connection that begins on the right side of a note could be changed to begin from the left, but not from the top or bottom. Use this option to preserve meaning in vertical and horizontal flow (e.g., top-to-bottom = time, left-to-right = details).


**In doubt, use `preserve axes`.**


In both cases, when no note is selected, the optimization is applied to the whole canvas.
