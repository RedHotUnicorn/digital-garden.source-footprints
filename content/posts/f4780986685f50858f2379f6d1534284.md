### Privacy



 We do **not** transmit or record the curl commands you enter or what they're converted to.
 This is a static website (hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)) and the conversion happens [entirely in your browser](https://github.com/curlconverter/curltorequests/blob/master/index.js) using JavaScript.
 



 There is also [a VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=curlconverter.curlconverter) and a command line tool you can install from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/curlconverter) with
 



`npm install -g curlconverter`
