 Hi, I am Akim Khalilov!
 



 I am a software development engineer with 12 years of experience working for small to mid and
 enterprise-level US companies.
 



 During my journey, I was wearing many different hats, starting from a rookie engineer and growing to a
 senior developer, then to a team lead, and then overseeing a team of 50 engineers. I spent about 300+
 hours interviewing people in tech for different roles and mentoring a dozen people who grew on my watch
 and improved their skill set. I find it interesting to challenge people and see how they grow.
 


I've been mentoring people and helping them with C#, JavaScript, SQL, time-management, GTD,
 communications, and more. 


With this website and interactive SQL tutorial, I want to help people gain
 knowledge in SQL and improve their skills by having hands-on experience in learning the language and
 applying it to lessons and tasks.


This is my first public product and I want it to be amazing. I am working on it iteratively and improving
 every day. I will create so many lessons as I can to make sure you got covered. And if it is required â€”
 I will mentor you personally so you make a progress.


I hope you will find these tutorials useful, and that will help you in learning SQL.
