In case you're interested in a quick visual comparison of Levenshtein and Difflib similarity, I calculated both for ~2.3 million book titles:



```
import codecs, difflib, Levenshtein, distance

with codecs.open("titles.tsv","r","utf-8") as f:
    title_list = f.read().split("\n")[:-1]

    for row in title_list:

        sr      = row.lower().split("\t")

        diffl   = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, sr[3], sr[4]).ratio()
        lev     = Levenshtein.ratio(sr[3], sr[4]) 
        sor     = 1 - distance.sorensen(sr[3], sr[4])
        jac     = 1 - distance.jaccard(sr[3], sr[4])

        print diffl, lev, sor, jac

```

I then plotted the results with R:

Strictly for the curious, I also compared the Difflib, Levenshtein, SÃ¸rensen, and Jaccard similarity values:



```
library(ggplot2)
require(GGally)

difflib <- read.table("similarity_measures.txt", sep = " ")
colnames(difflib) <- c("difflib", "levenshtein", "sorensen", "jaccard")

ggpairs(difflib)

```

Result:

The Difflib / Levenshtein similarity really is quite interesting.


2018 edit: If you're working on identifying similar strings, you could also check out minhashing--there's a [great overview here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf). Minhashing is amazing at finding similarities in large text collections in linear time. My lab put together an app that detects and visualizes text reuse using minhashing here: [https://github.com/YaleDHLab/intertext](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/intertext)
