Learner reviews from other DeepLearning.AI courses
--------------------------------------------------


> What I loved about the “AI for Everyone” course was the comprehensive coverage of essential AI topics, guided by the expertise of Andrew Ng. The course provided a clear roadmap for initiating and managing AI projects, from project selection to implementation. It also offered insights into building AI teams and introduced the technical tools necessary for AI success


> Simple enough to make it easy to understand in spite of being a complex topic, inspiring speaker. Time well spent, and a good fit with “lifelong learning” approach.


> What stood out to me about this course was the clarity and simplicity with which complex AI concepts were explained. The real-life examples and case studies helped me grasp the practical implications of AI in different sectors. The interactive nature of the course made learning engaging and enjoyable.


> I am an educator and looking to incorporate AI into my career and help my colleagues to do the same. The course did a great job explaining AI concepts to people like myself who are just learning about any of this for the first time.


> I took this course purely out of curiosity. After becoming aware of ChatGPT and Midjourney and then taking a short course on engineering the prompts to get the desired result, I became more intrigued with the topic of AI. I found this most helpful with regards to getting an idea about what AI actually is as opposed to what Hollywood conditioned me to believe it might be.


> Loved the content. It brought simplicity to the complex topic of AI, separated signal from noise, presented a great flow and covered the most relevant topics.
> 
> 
> Andrew’s knowledge and passion about the subject of AI was amazing. It was inspiring to listen to him, even via recorded videos. Its really great to be in this era of technology, as it makes it possible to get access to the wealth of knowledge so easily.
