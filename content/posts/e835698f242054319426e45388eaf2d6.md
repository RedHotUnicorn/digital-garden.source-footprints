remindful
=========


`remindful` is a macOS status bar app that displays firm but gentle periodic reminders.
It integrates well with the OS and works over fullscreen apps and across spaces.
It's useful for the Pomodoro Technique and reminding you to get up from your desk once in a while.


Left click the menu bar bar icon to toggle reminders, and right click it to access the `remindful` menu.
The default reminder interval is 30 minutes.

`remindful` has been tested on macOS 13 Ventura but may also work on other versions.
