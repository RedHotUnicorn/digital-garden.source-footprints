Appendix

### What is the "2-hop-link"?


[2-hop-link](#what-is-the-2-hop-link) are outgoing links in the current file, and files that have outgoing links to them.


For example, If there are relations as follows,



```
flowchart LR
    D[Dog] --> A[Animal]
    C[Cat] --> A
    O[Owl] --> A

```

[2-hop-link](#what-is-the-2-hop-link) from the "Dog" is as follows.



```
flowchart LR
    D[Dog]:::focus --> A[Animal]
    D[Dog]:::focus --> C[Cat]
    D[Dog]:::focus --> O[Owl]
    
    classDef focus fill:#f96

```

More complicated example.



```
flowchart LR
    Dog:::focus --> Animal
    Dog --> Masaru
    Zagitova --> Masaru
    Masaru --> Akita-inu
    Cat --> Animal
    Owl --> Animal
    Tama --> Cat
    Mike --> Cat
    Animal --> Zoo
    Zoo --> Animal
    Mahjong --> Zoo
    Animal --> Coffee
    classDef focus fill:#f96

```

[2-hop-link](#what-is-the-2-hop-link) from the "Dog" is as follows.



```
flowchart LR
    Dog:::focus --> Animal:::focus
    Dog --> Masaru:::focus
    Zagitova:::focus --> Masaru
    Masaru --> Akita-inu
    Cat:::focus --> Animal
    Owl:::focus --> Animal
    Tama --> Cat
    Mike --> Cat
    Animal --> Zoo
    Zoo:::focus --> Animal
