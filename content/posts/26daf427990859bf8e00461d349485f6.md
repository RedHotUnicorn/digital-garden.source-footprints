Team Maturity Model V2.0

If you have been following me you know I’ve been thinking and writing about team maturity. As I explained in the previous post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-team-mature-david-shrimpton/) all teams are at different levels of maturity and we as servant leaders, coaches and colleagues need to recognise how the team works collaborates and communicates with the entire organisation.

If you remember when thinking about what maturity is for a team I preferred the psychological definition which states it is:


> “the ability to respond to the environment aware of the correct time and location to behave and knowing when to act, according to the circumstances and the culture of the society one lives in.”

The purpose of this model is to recognise what stage a team could be at and help the individuals within the team and the team itself become better at responding to its environment through communication and collaboration.

Team Maturity Model V1.0

If we look at team maturity I believe there are four phases which I would define as “I’m alright Jack”, “Negotiation and Moderation”, “Better off Together” and “We Win as a Team”.

At this stage I’d like to thank Steve Sweales, Dan Ashby and Phil Thompson for their input and thoughts to help me improve the model to version 2.0. Also thanks to everyone who liked [Version 1.0](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-team-mature-david-shrimpton/?trackingId=Bj9OwePfQDOTN0Arm2KZgQ%3D%3D) and added their support.

> ‘Better communication and collaboration move the team through the maturity levels’

Team Maturity Scale using communication and collaboration

Stages of Maturity
==================

“I’m Alright Jack” is where the team is normally siloed. It can be selfish in its actions promoting the teams own objectives against the companies OKR’s and all other teams key results. A team is in this zone it is interested in their own outcomes. The team acts as a group of individuals and there is no communication to anyone else, no sharing, no co-operation. The team in this segment can be concerned with its own needs and possibly be cool and distant to the rest of the teams in the company.

Now with good coaching and support the team can move to the next stage of “Negotiation and Moderation”. This is where the team starts to communicate with the outside organisation and it increases its communication. It starts doing favours for other teams and puts in place agreements. It starts getting to know the organisational OKR’s and where its objectives fit in. The team starts to debate with each other and have dialogue with each other.

By taking part in “Negotiation and Moderation” the team moves to the next stage of “Better Off Together”. In this stage the team starts to collaborate, partner with other teams, has unity, harmony and asks for support. It has a good understanding of the company and teams OKR’s and objectives. It starts to have really great teamwork, group work with its division and collective work with the rest of the company.

And the last level is “We Win as a Team”. The team moves to have empowerment to become more confident and choose its own direction. The team moves to have its own autonomy, mastery and purpose through self-management. The team has purpose and leaders guide the team through servant leadership setting a direction. Most importantly the team becomes customer focused and has ownership over what it does, how it works and the direction it takes to deliver customer value.

Team Maturity Model V2.0

The new Team Maturity Model Version 2.0 includes a funnel with people or individuals going in and starting their journey through each of the stages. The outcome would hopefully be enhanced culture and maturity. At each stage collaboration, communication and autonomy or ownership increases.

Some teams may be at Phase 2 or Phase 3 they don’t have to start in Phase 1. It is also worth mentioning that some teams may move up or down the phases. This could be because of team changes, a pivot in direction, change in manager or culture and a change in the ways of working.

This is the second version and I’d really appreciate everyone’s support in helping improve this model. So please share this via liking the article or place a comment below.
