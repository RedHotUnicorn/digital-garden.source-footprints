It would be nice to have an **Instapaper for podcasts**, right?

To learn fast from many sources, on a single topic.

I use a method of queuing only the **individual episodes** that interest me **from many podcasts** and listening to them one after the other.

That’s how 👇

For example, I want to hear a lot of Daniel Vassallo’s interviews.

I go to [Listen Notes](https://medium.com/u/23f0353538c4?source=post_page-----b82d9cc32bfd--------------------------------) ([ListenNotes.com](https://www.listennotes.com/)) and in the search box I search for “Daniel Vassallo”

![]()The search result will return me a list of episodes

![]()For each episode that interests you

* click on “SAVE”
* select the checkbox of your playlist (create one if it doesn’t exist)

![]()Repeat for all the episodes you want to listen later.

When done, click on the “Listen Later” menu item

![]()Your “listening queue” will appear.

![]()Now we need to connect it to our podcast app.

First, we need to get the URL of the RSS feed:

* Click on “SUBSCRIBE”
* click on “Copy”

![]()And let’s save it in a mobile accessible location (I emailed it to me)

Once on the phone:

* copy the URL of the RSS feed (in my case, from the email I sent me)
* open the podcast app (I use Pocket Casts)
* open the podcast search menu

![]()* paste the URL of the RSS

![]()* select the playlist
* finally, press the “subscribe” button

![]()In this way, we have subscribed to our playlist and we will have the list of our episodes to listen to 💪
