**ArchiveBox is a powerful, self-hosted internet archiving solution to collect, save, and view websites offline.**


Without active preservation effort, everything on the internet eventually dissapears or degrades. Archive.org does a great job as a centralized service, but saved URLs have to be public, and they can’t save every type of content.


*ArchiveBox is an open source tool that lets organizations & individuals archive both public & private web content while retaining control over their data. It can be used to save copies of bookmarks, preserve evidence for legal cases, backup photos from FB/Insta/Flickr or media from YT/Soundcloud/etc., save research papers, and more…*
  




> ➡️ Get ArchiveBox with `pip install archivebox` on [Linux](#quickstart), [macOS](#quickstart), and [Windows](#quickstart) (WSL2), or via **[Docker](#quickstart)** ⭐️.


*Once installed, it can be used as a [CLI tool](#usage), [self-hosted Web App](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-Your-Archive), [Python library](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Usage#python-shell-usage), or [one-off command](#static-archive-exporting).*




---


📥 **You can feed ArchiveBox URLs one at a time, or schedule regular imports** from your bookmarks or history, social media feeds or RSS, link-saving services like Pocket/Pinboard, our [Browser Extension](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-browser-extension), and more.  

See [Input Formats](#input-formats) for a full list of supported input formats…


![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/90f1ce3c-75bb-401d-88ed-6297694b76ae)


**It saves snapshots of the URLs you feed it in several redundant formats.**



It also detects any content featured *inside* pages & extracts it out into a folder:

* 🌐 **HTML**/**Any websites** ➡️ `original HTML+CSS+JS`, `singlefile HTML`, `screenshot PNG`, `PDF`, `WARC`, `title`, `article text`, `favicon`, `headers`, …
* 🎥 **Social Media**/**News** ➡️ `post content TXT`, `comments`, `title`, `author`, `images`, …
* 🎬 **YouTube**/**SoundCloud**/etc. ➡️ `MP3/MP4`s, `subtitles`, `metadata`, `thumbnail`, …
* 💾 **Github**/**Gitlab**/etc. links ➡️ `clone of GIT source code`, `README`, `images`, …
* ✨ *and more, see [Output Formats](#output-formats) below…*


You can run ArchiveBox as a Docker web app to manage these snapshots, or continue accessing the same collection using the `pip`-installed CLI, Python API, and SQLite3 APIs. 
All the ways of using it are equivalent, and provide matching features like adding tags, scheduling regular crawls, viewing logs, and more…




---


🛠️ ArchiveBox uses [standard tools](#dependencies) like Chrome, [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), & [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), and stores data in [ordinary files & folders](#archive-layout).  

*(no complex proprietary formats, all data is readable without needing to run ArchiveBox)*


The goal is to sleep soundly knowing the part of the internet you care about will be automatically preserved in durable, easily accessible formats [for decades](#background--motivation) after it goes down.




---


**📦  Install ArchiveBox using your preferred method: `docker` / `pip` / `apt` / etc. ([see full Quickstart below](#quickstart)).**

```
# archivebox add --help
archivebox add 'https://example.com/some/page'
archivebox add --parser=generic_rss < ~/Downloads/some_feed.xml
archivebox add --depth=1 'https://news.ycombinator.com#2020-12-12'
echo 'http://example.com' | archivebox add
echo 'any text with <a href="https://example.com">urls</a> in it' | archivebox add

# if using Docker, add -i when piping stdin:

```

See the [Usage: CLI](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Usage#CLI-Usage) page for documentation and examples.


It also includes a built-in scheduled import feature with `archivebox schedule` and browser bookmarklet, so you can pull in URLs from RSS feeds, websites, or the filesystem regularly/on-demand.


Output Formats: What ArchiveBox saves for each URL
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/ace0954a-ddac-4520-9d18-1c77b1ec50b2)


For each web page added, ArchiveBox creates a Snapshot folder and preserves its content as ordinary files inside the folder (e.g. HTML, PDF, PNG, JSON, etc.).


It uses all available methods out-of-the-box, but you can disable extractors and fine-tune the [configuration](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration) as-needed.



*Expand to see the full list of ways it saves each page...*
`data/archive/{Snapshot.id}/`  

* **Index:** `index.html` & `index.json` HTML and JSON index files containing metadata and details
* **Title**, **Favicon**, **Headers** Response headers, site favicon, and parsed site title
* **SingleFile:** `singlefile.html` HTML snapshot rendered with headless Chrome using SingleFile
* **Wget Clone:** `example.com/page-name.html` wget clone of the site with `warc/TIMESTAMP.gz`
* Chrome Headless
	+ **PDF:** `output.pdf` Printed PDF of site using headless chrome
	+ **Screenshot:** `screenshot.png` 1440x900 screenshot of site using headless chrome
	+ **DOM Dump:** `output.html` DOM Dump of the HTML after rendering using headless chrome
* **Article Text:** `article.html/json` Article text extraction using Readability & Mercury
* **Archive.org Permalink:** `archive.org.txt` A link to the saved site on archive.org
* **Audio & Video:** `media/` all audio/video files + playlists, including subtitles & metadata w/ `yt-dlp`
* **Source Code:** `git/` clone of any repository found on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab links
* *More coming soon! See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Roadmap)...*



Configuration
-------------


![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/ea672e6b-4df5-49d8-b550-7f450951fd27)


ArchiveBox can be configured via environment variables, by using the `archivebox config` CLI, or by editing `./ArchiveBox.conf`.
  




*Expand to see examples...*

```
archivebox config                               # view the entire config
archivebox config --get CHROME_BINARY           # view a specific value

archivebox config --set CHROME_BINARY=chromium  # persist a config using CLI
# OR
echo CHROME_BINARY=chromium >> ArchiveBox.conf  # persist a config using file
# OR
env CHROME_BINARY=chromium archivebox ...       # run with a one-off config

```

These methods also work the same way when run inside Docker, see the [Docker Configuration](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker#configuration) wiki page for details.

The configuration is documented here: **[Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration)**, and loaded here: [`archivebox/config.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/config.py).



*Expand to see the most common options to tweak...*

```

# e.g. archivebox config --set TIMEOUT=120
# or   docker compose run archivebox config --set TIMEOUT=120

TIMEOUT=120                # default: 60    add more seconds on slower networks
CHECK_SSL_VALIDITY=True    # default: False True = allow saving URLs w/ bad SSL
SAVE_ARCHIVE_DOT_ORG=False # default: True  False = disable Archive.org saving
MAX_MEDIA_SIZE=1500m       # default: 750m  raise/lower youtubedl output size

PUBLIC_INDEX=True          # default: True  whether anon users can view index
PUBLIC_SNAPSHOTS=True      # default: True  whether anon users can view pages
PUBLIC_ADD_VIEW=False      # default: False whether anon users can add new URLs

CHROME_USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 ..."  # change these to get around bot blocking
WGET_USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 ..."
CURL_USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 ..."

```


Dependencies
------------


To achieve high-fidelity archives in as many situations as possible, ArchiveBox depends on a variety of 3rd-party libraries and tools that specialize in extracting different types of content.



> Under-the-hood, ArchiveBox uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) to power its [Web UI](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Usage#ui-usage) and [SQlite](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html) + the filesystem to provide [fast & durable metadata storage](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html) w/ [determinisitc upgrades](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39976321/2156113).


ArchiveBox bundles industry-standard tools like [Google Chrome](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Chromium-Install), [tuned, secured, and extended](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration) as-needed for many different applications.



*Expand to learn more about ArchiveBox's internals & dependencies...*  


> *TIP: For better security, easier updating, and to avoid polluting your host system with extra dependencies,**it is strongly recommended to use the [⭐️ official Docker image](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker)** with everything pre-installed for the best experience.*



These optional dependencies used for archiving sites include:

![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/62a02155-05d7-4f3e-8de5-75a50a145c4f)
* `chromium` / `chrome` (for screenshots, PDF, DOM HTML, and headless JS scripts)
* `node` & `npm` (for readability, mercury, and singlefile)
* `wget` (for plain HTML, static files, and WARC saving)
* `curl` (for fetching headers, favicon, and posting to Archive.org)
* `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` (for audio, video, and subtitles)
* `git` (for cloning git repos)
* `singlefile` (for saving into a self-contained html file)
* `postlight/parser` (for discussion threads, forums, and articles)
* `readability` (for articles and long text content)
* and more as we grow...



You don't need to install every dependency to use ArchiveBox. ArchiveBox will automatically disable extractors that rely on dependencies that aren't installed, based on what is configured and available in your `$PATH`.
 
If not using Docker, make sure to keep the dependencies up-to-date yourself and check that ArchiveBox isn't reporting any incompatibility with the versions you install.


```
#install python3 and archivebox with your system package manager
# apt/brew/pip/etc install ... (see Quickstart instructions above)

which -a archivebox    # see where you have installed archivebox
archivebox setup       # auto install all the extractors and extras
archivebox --version   # see info and check validity of installed dependencies

```

 
Installing directly on **Windows without Docker or WSL/WSL2/Cygwin is not officially supported** (I cannot respond to Windows support tickets), but some advanced users have reported getting it working.

Archive Layout
--------------


All of ArchiveBox’s state (SQLite DB, content, config, logs, etc.) is stored in a single folder per collection.



*Expand to learn more about the layout of Archivebox's data on-disk...*


Data folders can be created anywhere (`~/archivebox/data` or `$PWD/data` as seen in our examples), and you can create as many data folders as you want to hold different collections.
All `archivebox` CLI commands are designed to be run from inside an ArchiveBox data folder, starting with `archivebox init` to initialize a new collection inside an empty directory.


```
mkdir -p ~/archivebox/data && cd ~/archivebox/data   # just an example, can be anywhere
archivebox init
```


The on-disk layout is optimized to be easy to browse by hand and durable long-term. The main index is a standard `index.sqlite3` database in the root of the data folder (it can also be [exported as static JSON/HTML](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-Your-Archive#2-export-and-host-it-as-static-html)), and the archive snapshots are organized by date-added timestamp in the `data/archive/` subfolder.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511499/117453293-c7b91600-af12-11eb-8a3f-aa48b0f9da3c.png)

```
data/
    index.sqlite3
    ArchiveBox.conf
    archive/
        ...
        1617687755/
            index.html
            index.json
            screenshot.png
            media/some_video.mp4
            warc/1617687755.warc.gz
            git/somerepo.git
            ...

```


Each snapshot subfolder `data/archive/TIMESTAMP/` includes a static `index.json` and `index.html` describing its contents, and the snapshot extractor outputs are plain files within the folder.

#### Learn More


Static Archive Exporting
------------------------


You can create one-off archives of individual URLs with `archivebox oneshot`, or export your index as static HTML using `archivebox list` (so you can view it without an ArchiveBox server).



*Expand to learn how to export your ArchiveBox collection...*  


> *NOTE: These exports are not paginated, exporting many URLs or the entire archive at once may be slow. Use the filtering CLI flags on the `archivebox list` command to export specific Snapshots or ranges.*



```
# do a one-off single URL archive wihout needing a data dir initialized
archivebox oneshot 'https://example.com'

# archivebox list --help
archivebox list --html --with-headers > index.html     # export to static html table
archivebox list --json --with-headers > index.json     # export to json blob
archivebox list --csv=timestamp,url,title > index.csv  # export to csv spreadsheet

# (if using Docker Compose, add the -T flag when piping)
# docker compose run -T archivebox list --html 'https://example.com' > index.json

```


The paths in the static exports are relative, make sure to keep them next to your `./archive` folder when backing them up or viewing them.

Caveats
-------


### Archiving Private Content


If you’re importing pages with private content or URLs containing secret tokens you don’t want public (e.g Google Docs, paywalled content, unlisted videos, etc.), **you may want to disable some of the extractor methods to avoid leaking that content to 3rd party APIs or the public**.



*Expand to learn about privacy, permissions, and user accounts...*

```
# don't save private content to ArchiveBox, e.g.:
archivebox add 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/12345somePrivateDocument'
archivebox add 'https://vimeo.com/somePrivateVideo'

# without first disabling saving to Archive.org:
archivebox config --set SAVE_ARCHIVE_DOT_ORG=False  # disable saving all URLs in Archive.org

# restrict the main index, Snapshot content, and Add Page to authenticated users as-needed:
archivebox config --set PUBLIC_INDEX=False
archivebox config --set PUBLIC_SNAPSHOTS=False
archivebox config --set PUBLIC_ADD_VIEW=False 
archivebox manage createsuperuser

# if extra paranoid or anti-Google:
archivebox config --set SAVE_FAVICON=False          # disable favicon fetching (it calls a Google API passing the URL's domain part only)
archivebox config --set CHROME_BINARY=chromium      # ensure it's using Chromium instead of Chrome

```


> *CAUTION: Assume anyone *viewing* your archives will be able to see any cookies, session tokens, or private URLs passed to ArchiveBox during archiving.*
> *Make sure to secure your ArchiveBox data and don't share snapshots with others without stripping out sensitive headers and content first.*

### Security Risks of Viewing Archived JS


Be aware that malicious archived JS can access the contents of other pages in your archive when viewed. Because the Web UI serves all viewed snapshots from a single domain, they share a request context and **typical CSRF/CORS/XSS/CSP protections do not work to prevent cross-site request attacks**. See the [Security Overview](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Security-Overview#stealth-mode) page and [Issue #239](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/239) for more details.



*Expand to see risks and mitigations...*

```
# visiting an archived page with malicious JS:
https://127.0.0.1:8000/archive/1602401954/example.com/index.html

# example.com/index.js can now make a request to read everything from:
https://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
https://127.0.0.1:8000/archive/*
# then example.com/index.js can send it off to some evil server

```


> *NOTE: Only the `wget` & `dom` extractor methods execute archived JS when viewing snapshots, all other archive methods produce static output that does not execute JS on viewing.*  
> 
> *If you are worried about these issues ^ you should disable these extractors using:  
>  `archivebox config --set SAVE_WGET=False SAVE_DOM=False`.*

### Working Around Sites that Block Archiving


For various reasons, many large sites (Reddit, Twitter, Cloudflare, etc.) actively block archiving or bots in general. There are a number of approaches to work around this, and we also provide [consulting services](https://docs.monadical.com/s/archivebox-consulting-services) to help here.



*Click to learn how to set up user agents, cookies, and site logins...*
  

* Set
* Set up a logged-in browser session for archiving using [`CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR` & `COOKIES_FILE`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Chromium-Install#setting-up-a-chromium-user-profile)
* Rewrite your URLs before archiving to swap in alternative frontends that are more bot-friendly e.g.  

`reddit.com/some/url` -> `teddit.net/some/url`: [https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends)



In the future we plan on adding support for running JS scripts during archiving to block ads, cookie popups, modals, and fix other issues. Follow here for progress: [Issue #51](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/51).


### Saving Multiple Snapshots of a Single URL


ArchiveBox appends a hash with the current date `https://example.com#2020-10-24` to differentiate when a single URL is archived multiple times.



*Click to learn how the `Re-Snapshot` feature works...*




Because ArchiveBox uniquely identifies snapshots by URL, it must use a workaround to take multiple snapshots of the same URL (otherwise they would show up as a single Snapshot entry). It makes the URLs of repeated snapshots unique by adding a hash with the archive date at the end:


```
archivebox add 'https://example.com#2020-10-24'
...
archivebox add 'https://example.com#2020-10-25'

```


The ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511499/115942091-73c02300-a476-11eb-958e-5c1fc04da488.png) button in the Admin UI is a shortcut for this hash-date multi-snapshotting workaround.

Improved support for saving multiple snapshots of a single URL without this hash-date workaround will be [added eventually](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/179) (along with the ability to view diffs of the changes between runs).

### Storage Requirements


Because ArchiveBox is designed to ingest a large volume of URLs with multiple copies of each URL stored by different 3rd-party tools, it can be quite disk-space intensive. There are also some special requirements when using filesystems like NFS/SMB/FUSE.



*Click to learn more about ArchiveBox's filesystem and hosting requirements...*
  

* **ArchiveBox can use anywhere from ~1gb per 1000 Snapshots, to ~50gb per 1000 Snapshots**, mostly dependent on whether you're saving audio & video using `SAVE_MEDIA=True` and whether you lower `MEDIA_MAX_SIZE=750mb`.
* Disk usage can be reduced by using a compressed/[deduplicated](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/ixsystems-and-klara-systems-celebrate-valentines-day-with-a-heartfelt-donation-of-fast-dedupe-to-openzfs-and-truenas/) filesystem like [ZFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/t9cexx/a_simple_real_world_zfs_compression_speed_an/)/BTRFS, or by turning off extractors methods you don't need. You can also deduplicate content with a tool like [`fdupes`](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes) or [`rdfind`](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind).
* **Don't store large collections on older filesystems like EXT3/FAT** as they may not be able to handle more than 50k directory entries in the `data/archive/` folder.
* **Try to keep the `data/index.sqlite3` file on local drive (not a network mount)** or SSD for maximum performance, however the `data/archive/` folder can be on a network mount or slower HDD.
* If using Docker or NFS/SMB/FUSE for the `data/archive/` folder, you may need to set [`PUID` & `PGID`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#puid--pgid) and [disable `root_squash`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/1304) on your fileshare server.

Background & Motivation
=======================


ArchiveBox aims to enable more of the internet to be saved from deterioration by empowering people to self-host their own archives. The intent is for all the web content you care about to be viewable with common software in 50 - 100 years without needing to run ArchiveBox or other specialized software to replay it.



*Click to read more about why archiving is important and how to do it ethically...*




Vast treasure troves of knowledge are lost every day on the internet to link rot. As a society, we have an imperative to preserve some important parts of that treasure, just like we preserve our books, paintings, and music in physical libraries long after the originals go out of print or fade into obscurity.

Whether it's to resist censorship by saving news articles before they get taken down or edited, or just to save a collection of early 2010's flash games you loved to play, having the tools to archive internet content enables to you save the stuff you care most about before it disappears.


![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/71e36bc5-1c94-44e2-92b6-405fa898c734)  

*Image from [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/)...*


The balance between the permanence and ephemeral nature of content on the internet is part of what makes it beautiful. I don't think everything should be preserved in an automated fashion--making all content permanent and never removable, but I do think people should be able to decide for themselves and effectively archive specific content that they care about, just like libraries do. Without the work of archivists saving physical books, manuscrips, and paintings we wouldn't have any knowledge of our ancestors' history. I believe archiving the web is just as important to provide the same benefit to future generations.

ArchiveBox's stance is that duplication of other people's content is only ethical if it:

- A. doesn't deprive the original creators of revenue and
- B. is responsibly curated by an individual/institution.

In the U.S., [libraries, researchers, and archivists](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/copyright/libraries) are allowed to duplicate copyrighted materials under ["fair use"](https://libguides.ala.org/copyright/fairuse) for [private study, scholarship, or research](https://guides.cuny.edu/cunyfairuse/librarians#:~:text=One%20of%20these%20specified%20conditions,may%20be%20liable%20for%20copyright). Archive.org's non-profit preservation work is [covered under fair use](https://blog.archive.org/2024/03/01/fair-use-in-action-at-the-internet-archive/) in the US, and they properly handle [unethical content](https://cardozoaelj.com/2015/03/20/use-of-copyright-law-to-take-down-revenge-porn/)/[DMCA](https://help.archive.org/help/rights/)/[GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/#:~:text=An%20individual%20has%20the%20right,that%20individual%20withdraws%20their%20consent.) removal requests to maintain good standing in the eyes of the law.

As long as you A. don't try to profit off pirating copyrighted content and B. have processes in place to respond to removal requests, many countries allow you to use sofware like ArchiveBox to ethically and responsibly archive any web content you can view. That being said, ArchiveBox is not liable for how you choose to operate the software. You must research your own local laws and regulations, and get proper legal council if you plan to host a public instance (start by putting your DMCA/GDPR contact info in [`FOOTER_INFO`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#footer_info) and changing your instance's branding using [`CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIR`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#custom_templates_dir)).

Comparison to Other Projects
----------------------------


![](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/assets/511499/4cac62a9-e8fb-425b-85a3-ca644aa6dd42)



> **Check out our [community wiki](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community) for a list of alternative web archiving tools and orgs.**


ArchiveBox gained momentum in the internet archiving industry because it uniquely combines 3 things:


* **it’s distributed:** users own their data instead of entrusting it to one big central provider
* **it’s future-proof:** saving in *multiple formats* and extracting out raw TXT, PNG, PDF, MP4, etc. files
* **it’s extensible:** with powerful APIs, flexible storage, and a big community adding new extractors regularly



*Expand for a more direct comparison to Archive.org and specific open-source alternatives...*


ArchiveBox tries to be a robust, set-and-forget archiving solution suitable for archiving RSS feeds, bookmarks, or your entire browsing history (beware, it may be too big to store), including private/authenticated content that you wouldn't otherwise share with a centralized service like Archive.org.

### Comparison With Centralized Public Archives



Not all content is suitable to be archived on a centralized, publicly accessible platform. Archive.org doesn't offer the ability to save things behind login walls for good reason, as the content may not have been intended for a public audience. ArchiveBox exists to fill that gap by letting everyone save what they have access to on an individual basis, and to encourage decentralized archiving that's less succeptible to censorship or natural disasters.

By having users store their content locally or within their organizations, we can also save much larger portions of the internet than a centralized service has the disk capcity handle. The eventual goal is to work towards federated archiving where users can share portions of their collections with each other, and with central archives on a case-by-case basis.

### Comparison With Other Self-Hosted Archiving Options



ArchiveBox differentiates itself from [similar self-hosted projects](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#Web-Archiving-Projects) by providing both a comprehensive CLI interface for managing your archive, a Web UI that can be used either independently or together with the CLI, and a simple on-disk data format that can be used without either.


\*If you want better fidelity for very complex interactive pages with heavy JS/streams/API requests, check out [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page) and [ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page).\*

\*If you want more bookmark categorization and note-taking features, check out [Archivy](https://archivy.github.io/), [Memex](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex), [Polar](https://getpolarized.io/), or [LinkAce](https://www.linkace.org/).\*

\*If you need more advanced recursive spider/crawling ability beyond `--depth=1`, check out [Browsertrix](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler), [Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon), or [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and pipe the outputted URLs into ArchiveBox.\*

For more alternatives, see our [list here](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#Web-Archiving-Projects)...

ArchiveBox is neither the highest fidelity nor the simplest tool available for self-hosted archiving, rather it's a jack-of-all-trades that tries to do most things well by default. We encourage you to try these other tools made by our friends if ArchiveBox isn't suited to your needs.

**Python API Documentation:** https://docs.archivebox.io/en/dev/archivebox.html#module-archivebox.main


### Setup the dev environment


*Click to expand...*

#### 1. Clone the main code repo (making sure to pull the submodules as well)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox
cd ArchiveBox
git checkout dev # or the branch you want to test
git submodule update --init --recursive
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

#### 2. Option A: Install the Python, JS, and system dependencies directly on your machine

```bash
# Install ArchiveBox + python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e '.[dev]'
# or: pipenv install --dev && pipenv shell

# Install node dependencies
npm install
# or
archivebox setup

# Check to see if anything is missing
archivebox --version
# install any missing dependencies manually, or use the helper script:
./bin/setup.sh
```

#### 2. Option B: Build the docker container and use that for development instead

```bash
# Optional: develop via docker by mounting the code dir into the container
# if you edit e.g. ./archivebox/core/models.py on the docker host, runserver
# inside the container will reload and pick up your changes
docker build . -t archivebox
docker run -it \
 -v $PWD/data:/data \
 archivebox init --setup
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 \
 -v $PWD/data:/data \
 -v $PWD/archivebox:/app/archivebox \
 archivebox server 0.0.0.0:8000 --debug --reload

# (remove the --reload flag and add the --nothreading flag when profiling with the django debug toolbar)
# When using --reload, make sure any files you create can be read by the user in the Docker container, eg with 'chmod a+rX'.
```


### Common development tasks


See the `./bin/` folder and read the source of the bash scripts within.
You can also run all these in Docker. For more examples see the GitHub Actions CI/CD tests that are run: `.github/workflows/*.yaml`.


#### Run in DEBUG mode


*Click to expand...*

```bash
archivebox config --set DEBUG=True
# or
archivebox server --debug ...
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1074212/how-can-i-see-the-raw-sql-queries-django-is-running


#### Install and run a specific GitHub branch


*Click to expand...*

##### Use a Pre-Built Image

If you're looking for the latest `dev` Docker image, it's often available pre-built on Docker Hub, simply pull and use `archivebox/archivebox:dev`.

```bash
docker pull archivebox/archivebox:dev
docker run archivebox/archivebox:dev version
# verify the BUILD\_TIME and COMMIT\_HASH in the output are recent
```

##### Build Branch from Source
 
You can also build and run any branch yourself from source, for example to build & use `dev` locally:

```bash
# docker-compose.yml:
services:
 archivebox:
 image: archivebox/archivebox:dev
 build: 'https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox.git#dev'
 ...

# or with plain Docker:
docker build -t archivebox:dev https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox.git#dev
docker run -it -v $PWD:/data archivebox:dev init --setup

# or with pip:
pip install 'git+https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox@dev'
npm install 'git+https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox.git#dev'
archivebox init --setup
```


#### Run the linters / tests


*Click to expand...*

```bash
./bin/lint.sh
./bin/test.sh
```
(uses `flake8`, `mypy`, and `pytest -s`)


#### Make DB migrations, enter Django shell, other dev helper commands


*Click to expand...*

```bash
# generate the database migrations after changes to models.py
cd archivebox/
./manage.py makemigrations

# enter a python shell or a SQL shell
cd path/to/test/data/
archivebox shell
archivebox manage dbshell

# generate a graph of the ORM models
brew install graphviz
pip install pydot graphviz
archivebox manage graph\_models -a -o orm.png
open orm.png

# list all models with field db info and methods
archivebox manage list\_model\_info --all --signature --db-type --field-class

# print all django settings
archivebox manage print\_settings
archivebox manage print\_settings --format=yaml # pip install pyyaml

# autogenerate an admin.py from given app models
archivebox manage admin\_generator core > core/admin.py

# dump db data to a script that re-populates it
archivebox manage dumpscript core > scripts/testdata.py
archivebox manage reset core
archivebox manage runscript testdata

# resetdb and clear all data!
archivebox manage reset\_db

# use django-tui to interactively explore commands
pip install django-tui
# ensure django-tui is in INSTALLED\_APPS: core/settings.py
archivebox manage tui

# show python and JS package dependency trees
pdm list --tree
npm ls --all
```

#### Contributing a new extractor


*Click to expand...*
  



ArchiveBox [`extractors`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/extractors/media.py) are external binaries or Python/Node scripts that ArchiveBox runs to archive content on a page.

Extractors take the URL of a page to archive, write their output to the filesystem `data/archive/TIMESTAMP/EXTRACTOR/...`, and return an [`ArchiveResult`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/core/models.py#:~:text=return%20qs-,class%20ArchiveResult,-(models.Model)%3A) entry which is saved to the database (visible on the `Log` page in the UI).

\*Check out how we added \*\*[`archivebox/extractors/singlefile.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/extractors/singlefile.py)\*\* as an example of the process: [Issue #399](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/399) + [PR #403](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/pull/403).\*




\*\*The process to contribute a new extractor is like this:\*\*

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/new?assignees=&labels=changes%3A+behavior%2Cstatus%3A+idea+phase&template=feature\_request.md&title=Feature+Request%3A+...) with your propsoed implementation (please link to the pages of any new external dependencies you plan on using)
2. Ensure any dependencies needed are easily installable via a package managers like `apt`, `brew`, `pip3`, `npm`
 (Ideally, prefer to use external programs available via `pip3` or `npm`, however we do support using any binary installable via package manager that exposes a CLI/Python API and writes output to stdout or the filesystem.)
3. Create a new file in [`archivebox/extractors/EXTRACTOR.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/extractors) (copy an existing extractor like [`singlefile.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/extractors/singlefile.py) as a template)
4. Add config settings to enable/disable any new dependencies and the extractor as a whole, e.g. `USE\_DEPENDENCYNAME`, `SAVE\_EXTRACTORNAME`, `EXTRACTORNAME\_SOMEOTHEROPTION` in [`archivebox/config.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/config.py)
5. Add a preview section to [`archivebox/templates/core/snapshot.html`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/templates/core/snapshot.html) to view the output, and a column to [`archivebox/templates/core/index\_row.html`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/archivebox/templates/core/index\_row.html) with an icon for your extractor
6. Add an integration test for your extractor in [`tests/test\_extractors.py`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/tests/test\_extractors.py)
7. [Submit your PR for review!](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) 🎉
8. Once merged, please document it in these places and anywhere else you see info about other extractors:
 - https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox#output-formats
 - https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#archive-method-toggles
 - https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Install#dependencies
