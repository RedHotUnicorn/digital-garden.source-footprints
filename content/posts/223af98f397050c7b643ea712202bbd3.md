Future Letter Ideas!




 Hi there! Writing a letter to the future can be a powerful experience. And receiving a surprise letter from the past can be an even more powerful experience. Check out the testimonials [all of the people who agree!](/props).
 



 Here are some ideas for a future letter:
 1. To your next birthday (obviously!)
2. To a date by which you predict we are "back to normal" and recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. What did we learn?
3. Uma data que voc√™ atingiu um objetivo importante (Se formou? Se casou? Aposentou!)
4. Write a story in present tense about your life in 5 years ("You are sipping coffee in your new home...") and paint a picture of your future self's day.
5. To yourself, when you will be your parents age.
6. To your kids, when they will be your age. Or to the age when you think you will have kids.
7. To your spouse/partner, on your 10th (20th? 50th?) anniversary (you must create an account first to write to someone else!)
8. To the year 2030, when the IPCC says we must hit Greenhouse Gas Reduction goals to keep Global Warming below 1.5 degrees celsius.
9. To yourself, while you're on your next vacation.
10. ...Or...while on vacation, to yourself when you've back "to the grind."
