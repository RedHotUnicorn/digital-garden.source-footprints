Get more out of RSS feeds, for free

Turn any **truncated RSS feed** (which only provides a
 small intro), **into a full-text RSS feed** (with full
 articles). If needed, turn any web page into a RSS feed.



Some examples of feeds you can use:


http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml
http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss
https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
Some examples of websites you can use:

### FAQ


#### What does this website do?


The goal of this website is to improve RSS feeds. A lot of newspapers
 only provide a **small intro** of their articles in their
 RSS feeds. As this is not really convenient, morss.it turns those
 shortened RSS feeds **into feeds with full articles**. To
 visualize the result, have a look at the [before-after illustration](/before-after.png).


Also some newspapers don't provide RSS feeds at all. morss.it makes
 it possible to **quickly create a RSS feed** for such
 websites with an easy to use interface. You can look at [this video](/select-items.webm) to see how the feed creation
 tool works.


Although morss.it can build custom RSS feeds for websites, it is
 recommended, where possible, to use the RSS feeds provided by the
 websites. Usually Googling "*website* RSS
 feed" is enough to find the feed.


#### What are RSS feeds anyway?


[RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) provide a
 powerful and convenient tool to receive newsletters from your favorite
 websites and newspapers without flooding your mailbox and without
 relying on Facebook/Twitter/Google. The library of NYU lists [some popular
 feeds](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276615&p=1845079).


News from RSS feeds can be read with newsreaders, which are available
 for virtually all platforms (PC, Mac, Android, iOS). They can provide
 handy features, such as an offline mode, synchronisation across devices,
 etc. Lifehacker has made a [review](https://lifehacker.com/the-best-rss-readers-and-news-aggregation-apps-1839030732)
 of some popular newsreaders. My personal favorite is [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) (self-hosted), but do as
 you feel!


#### I can't get anyting to work


This website does not support Internet Explorer at all. Edge and
 Safari are mostly supported but some features might not work. Please use
 [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) or Chrome for
 optimal results.


If you enconter a major issue, you can check [status updates](https://github.com/pictuga/morss/issues/82). If
 needed, please [open an
 issue](https://github.com/pictuga/morss/issues).


#### When creating a feed, I can't select the links I want


If an element is blocking you from selecting the links you want (e.g.
 a pop-up), right click on the blocking element to delete it.


Some websites generate their content dynamically in your browser,
 using javascript (e.g. Google Maps). The server of morss.it however does
 not have javascript enabled (as it would require a lot of resources) and
 therefore can't detect the links on those websites. If possible, try to
 find another non-dynamic ("static") page on the same website with the
 same content. There is no other real work around for this. 


Sometimes the selection tool can't select the *right* group of
 links (i.e. too many links selected, or not enough). To work around it,
 the only option is to use custom [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) rules. For this
 you'll need some knownledge of XPath. This can be tedious, but will give
 you great flexibility to select the links you want.


#### What if the tool doesn't work with a website?


For some popular websites (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), the
 server of morss tends to get quickly blocked/banned. Therefore you might
 want to use [rss Bridge](https://sebsauvage.net/rss-bridge/)
 or [RSS Box](https://rssbox.herokuapp.com/) to get these
 feeds. (Please note that rss Bridge and RSS Box are not
 affiliated/related to morss.it in any way. They are however both free
 & open source.)
