1) More than 5000 spacecraft, including all active satellites, classified military satellites, the International Space Station, and SpaceX's Starlink communication satellites.  
  
2) Rich new graphics, rewritten using Apple's Metal graphics API, show atmospheric effects, city lights on Earthâ€™s night side, and highly-detailed 3D satellite models.  
  
3) Radio frequency data for amateur radio satellites.  
  
4) Updated descriptions for hundreds of spacecraft. Every satellite now has a description from n2yo.com.  
  
7) Supports any Intel or Apple Silicon Mac running MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) and MacOS 11 (Big Sur). Includes native ARM code for Apple Silicon!
