Container Desktop
=================


Container Desktop is an open-source alternative to Docker Desktop. It enables you to build, push, pull and run Linux containers on Microsoft Windows, by providing a seamless integration with Docker Engine Community Edition running on Windows Subsystem for Linux. The Container Desktop bundles the open-source docker and docker-compose cli clients for a native and simple user experience.


How it works?
-------------


[![](/container-desktop/container-desktop/raw/main/docs/static/img/container-desktop-overview.png)](/container-desktop/container-desktop/blob/main/docs/static/img/container-desktop-overview.png)


Container Desktop Proxy handles the communication with the Docker Engine running in container-desktop distribution within Windows System Linux v2 (WSL2). The proxy enables native docker experience on Microsoft Windows, where it translates Windows Paths to WSL2 paths local to the container-desktop distribution.


With the Container Desktop System Tray Application you can manage the behavior of container-desktop. You can start, stop and restart the Container Desktop Proxy on the Windows Host or Enable or Disable a Docker Engine proxy in any available WSL2 distribution.
Container Desktop installs the docker and the docker-compose command line interface tools.



> Note: Container Desktop will not support Windows Containers.


Supported features
------------------


* Run Docker daemon in its own distribution
* Use 'docker' and 'docker-compose' cli on Windows and enabled WSL2 Distributions to connect to the daemon.
* You can use Windows paths as volumes, the container-desktop-proxy translates these paths to WSL2 paths local to the daemon distribution
* Start/stop/restart and quit Container Desktop by right clicking on the icon in the system tray.
* Enable container-desktop integration in installed WSL2 distributions.
* Use Port Forwarding to expose containers on a specific network.
* Configure DNS Mode for Container Desktop (WLS2/Primary Network Adapter/Static).
