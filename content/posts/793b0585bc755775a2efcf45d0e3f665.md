Obsidian Overdue Plugin
=======================


This plugin marks checkbox items as `[[Overdue]]` if you do not check them off by their due date.
For instance, say you have items like the following:



```
# In file 2020-01-01.md

- [x] Something I completed
- [ ] Something I didn't

# In another-file.md

- [x] Something else I completed [[2020-01-02]]
- [ ] Something else I forgot about [[2020-02-15]]
```

When the plugin runs any time after January 1st, 2020 *local time*, it will make the following changes:



```
# In file 2020-01-01.md

- [x] Something I completed
- [ ] Something I didn't [[Overdue]]

# In another-file.md

- [x] Something else I completed [[2020-01-02]]
- [ ] Something else I forgot about [[2020-02-15]] [[Overdue]]
```

The plugin runs automatically just after midnight to update your pages. You can also trigger the
plugin using `Overdue: Mark overdue items` in the Obsidian command palette.


Opening a backlinks panel for the `Overdue` page shows all of your overdue items in one location.


The plugin only adds `[[Overdue]]` references, never removes them. When you complete an overdue
item, check it off and delete the `[[Overdue]]` text to stop it from appearing in the overdue
backlinks.
