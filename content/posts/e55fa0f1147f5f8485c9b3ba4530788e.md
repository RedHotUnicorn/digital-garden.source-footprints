obsidian-starter-vault by Alex Yaroslavskiy
===========================================


Welcome to my starter vault! I hope you enjoy perusing through this setup. I have included a tutorial for starting use of this vault, whether you are new to obsidian or not. To get started, install Obsidian, pull down this repo, and start a vault from the parent directory. Then, see [[learning this vault]].
