### Logseq Cinematograph



Cinematograph or Kinematograph is an early term for several types of motion picture film mechanisms. A device by this name was invented and patented as the "Cinématographe Léon Bouly" by French inventor Léon Bouly on February 12, 1892. Bouly coined the term "cinematograph," from the Greek for **"writing in movement."** — [Cinematograph - Wikipedia]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematograph))

About The Project
-----------------


[![](/QWxleA/cinematograph/raw/main/images/screenshot.gif)](/QWxleA/cinematograph/blob/main/images/screenshot.gif)


Take notes from a Youtube video is easy enough, but gets annoying when you have too many. And second-guessing yourself also makes it slow going, at times.


All that is solved with this plugin. You can't see what you typed, it just disappears until you're done. Just concentrate on your video, your notes will be there when you're finished. And you type right under the video, so you never scroll too far down.
