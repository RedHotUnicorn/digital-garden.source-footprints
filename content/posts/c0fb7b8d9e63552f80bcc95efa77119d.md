Criteria
--------


Open-source company is added to the list if:


1. Its product is strongly based on an open-source repo
2. It has a well-known closed-source competitor, solving a similar business problem
3. It is a private for-profit company, founded in the last 10 years
4. Its repo has 100+ stars on GitHub


Things change really fast in the startup world, so this list can neither be fully complete, nor 100% up to date.
