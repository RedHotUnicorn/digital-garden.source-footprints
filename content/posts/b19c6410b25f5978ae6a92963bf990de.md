What makes writing more readable?
=================================



An examination of translating text to make it as accessible as possible.
 




Looking at how to make writing easier to read

The following is a toggle that allows you to change whether the text is standard or
 translated
 into plain language. Press the p key at any time to switch between standard and plain language
 versions of the article. If you are using a screen reader, you will need to disable your the quick
 navigation keyboard commands in order for the P key to function.
 


Plain
 Language
(Or use the "p" key)


Writing text that can be understood by as many people as possible seems like an
 obvious best practice. But from news media to legal guidance to academic research, the way we write often
 creates barriers to who can read it. Plain languageâa style of writing that uses simplified sentences,
 everyday vocabulary, and clear structureâaims to remove those barriers.

Plain language is useful for everyone, but especially for those who are often denied
 the opportunity to engage with and comment on public writing. This includes the [20% of the population with learning
 disabilities](https://www.ncld.org/research/state-of-learning-disabilities), a number of the [more than 7
 million people in the US](https://ici-s.umn.edu/files/aCHyYaFjMi/risp_2017) with intellectual disabilities (ID), readers for whom English is not a first
 language and people with limited access to education, among others.

These audiences are routinely excluded from public dialogues, including dialogues
 about themselves. People with disabilities are also often excluded from writing or sharing their own stories
 first-hand due to lower vocabulary skills, learning differences, and intellectual disabilities. For example,
 throughout much of US history, people with ID [have had decisions made
 on their behalf](https://ncd.gov/sites/default/files/NCD_Turning-Rights-into-Reality_508_0.pdf) based on the presumption that they do not and cannot understand. This, on top of
 discriminatory attitudes and stigma, has led to [infantilization](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nosmag.org/mental-age-theory-hurts-people-with-intellectual-disabilities/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1641598391812179&usg=AOvVaw1oFiTrpzcEMoYjnn3cB96G),

Additionally, there is a tendency to censor content for these audiences rather than
 explain it, which can contribute to continued disparities, like the [higher rate](https://thearc.org/wp-content/uploads/forchapters/Sexual%20Violence.pdf) at which
 people with ID experience sexual violence than nondisabled people.

The benefits of plain language arenât limited to universally challenging texts like
 legal documents and tax forms. Even everyday writing, like news articles, can still pose a barrier for some
 readers.

### Plain language translating: side-by-side comparison


ORIGINAL


PLAIN LANGUAGE



Kyra is autistic and deaf. She was born early. She was
 very small when she was born. She has trouble seeing,
 hearing, eating and sleeping. Her hand shakes so she does
 not do sign language. Her parents think she knows some
 signs.

More about Rebeccaâs translation process

When doing a plain language translation, my first step is always to do a close read
 of the original text. I identify the main points, the order information is presented, and any terms or
 concepts that I think will need to be defined or replaced. I always think to myself âwhat does this
 sentence/idea/concept assume the reader already knows?â There is so much implied in how we write, and
 plain language should aim to make the implicit more explicit.

 write, and plain language should aim to make the implicit more explicit.
 




Once I start translating, I typically take a paragraph-by-paragraph approach rather
 than sentence-by-sentence, because often I will need to re-order information, add definitions or examples,
 or reintroduce characters and ideas at the top of a new paragraph. Focusing too much on the sentence-level
 translation can mean losing sight of the bigger picture.

How do algorithms try to assess readability?
--------------------------------------------



As more people have recognized the practical value of plain language, researchers
 have sought to quantify the âplainnessâ of writing through readability formulasâmathematical models that
 assign numerical scores to text, indicating how understandable they are.

Though most readability formulas were designed to offer rough difficulty estimates
 for specific groups of readers, their usage varies greatly, with the Agency for Healthcare Research and
 Quality [warning](https://www.ahrq.gov/talkingquality/resources/writing/tip6.html) that âthese
 formulas are often interpreted and used in ways that go well beyond what they measure.â

Moreover, the simplicity of readability checkers has enabled their widespread

 guide communication for a general audience. Schools and textbook manufacturers use them to tailor reading
 assignments to particular grade levels and students.

### Algorithm #1: Syllable Count



The Flesch-Kincaid Grade level formula looks, in part, at syllable count, based on
 the idea that words with fewer syllables are easier to understand.

 on the idea that words with fewer syllables are easier to understand.
 






An interactive showing what the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm considers a easy, medium,
 and hard
 sentence. The algorithm deems sentences with lower syllable counts to be easier, so when long
 multisyllabic words are added (even if they are easy words), the algorithm says it's a hard
 sentence. If we add short but obscure words, the algorithm thinks it's an easier sentence. We
 see that the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm isn't able to handle much complexity when it comes to
 assessing readability.


### What happens if we only care about **syllables**


Change reading level
Easy
Medium
Hard
The below text is at a 2.34 (2nd
 grade)
 grade reading level according to Flesch-Kincaid
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
The dun fox cleared that slouch of a dog at full tilt. 
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. 
The wonderful, beautiful
 fox jumped over the unbelievably lazy
 dog. 

The two factors considered by FleschâKincaid are number of words per sentence and
 number of syllables per word. This is a short sentence with only two multi-syllable words
 (**âoverâ** and **âlazyâ**), so the FleschâKincaid formula assigns it a low grade
 level.
 





More about this algorithm

The author Rudolf Flesch made a career as an early evangelist for plain language in
 the mid-20th century, promoting his namesake Flesch Reading-Ease Test and its cousin, the Flesch-Kincaid
 Grade Level Formula, developed in 1975 under contract with the U.S. Navy. It was calibrated on the reading
 comprehension scores of 531 enlisted Navy personnel, in order to measure readability in the specific
 context of technical communication. Today, perhaps thanks to its misleading name, the F-K Grade Level
 Formula is used in schools to estimate reading difficulty for children, overlooking the obvious fact that
 elementary school students and naval cadets may not agree on whether the same text is easy or difficult to
 understand.

### Algorithm #2: Difficult words



The Dale-Chall Readability Formula considers the proportion of difficult words, where
 it deems a word âdifficultâ if it is not on a list of 3,000 words familiar to fourth-grade students.

 where it deems a word âdifficultâ if it is not on a list of 3,000 words familiar to fourth-grade
 students.
 




One risk in the use of vocabulary lists is that the vocabulary of the readers
 surveyed to create them may not match the vocabulary of the intended audience. The original Dale-Chall list
 of âfamiliar wordsâ was compiled in 1948 through a survey of U.S. fourth-graders, and even the most recent
 update to the list in 1995 retains obsolete words like âNegroâ and âhomelyâ while omitting âcomputer.â

 âcomputer.â
 






An interactive showing what the Dale-Chall algorithm considers a easy, medium, and
 hard
 sentence. Dale-Chall considers average sentence length along with how many difficult words are
 used, where âdifficultâ words are words that don't appear on the Dale-Chall list. If we add
 words that are unfamiliar (like dinosaur or dude) the algorithm says it's a difficult
 sentence. If we simply add a sentence that just contains the exclamation "Yes!", that lowers
 the average sentence length and makes the algorithm say it's an easier sentence. We see that
 the Dale-Chall algorithm isn't able to handle much complexity when it comes to assessing
 readability.


### What happens if we only care about **âdifficultâ words**


Change reading level
Easy
Medium
Hard
The below text is at a 0.45 (4th
 grade or below)
 grade reading level according to Dale-Chall
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Yes! The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. 
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. 
The quick brown dinosaur jumped over the lazy dude. 

DaleâChall considers average sentence length along with percentage of difficult words
 (PDW), where âdifficultâ words are words that don't appear on the DaleâChall list. This is a short sentence
 made entirely of words on the DaleâChall list, so its ASL score is low and its PDW score is zero, yielding a
 score of 0.45. Since the formula was calibrated on a group of 4th grade students, all scores below 5.0 are
 collapsed into a single readability category representing â4th grade and below.â
 




### Algorithm #3: Algorithmic black boxes



More recently, US schools and textbook manufacturers have standardized their
 curricula on the Lexile Framework for Reading, a set of readability algorithms and vocabulary lists designed
 to automatically match students with appropriately difficult books. Publishers apply Lexile to their texts
 to rate their difficulty. A Lexile score of 210 indicates an easy-to-read book, while a score of 1730
 indicates a very challenging one. A reading comprehension test assigns a corresponding reading score to each
 student, after which teachers pair students with texts that have comparable Lexile scores.

 scores.
 




The approach sounds simple enough, but critics have pointed out absurdities in
 Lexile's results. According to Lexile, The Grapes of Wrath (Lexile score: 680) is easier to understand than
 the Nancy Drew mystery Nancy's Mysterious Letter (score: 720), but neither of these is as challenging as The
 Library Mouse (score: 860), a 32-page illustrated children's book.

Images of three book covers arranged by how difficult the Lexile algorithm thinks
 they are. It
 says Grapes of Wrath is the easiest, followed by Nancy's Mysterious Letter, and the hardest is
 The Library Mouse, a 32-page illustrated children's book. This doesn't make much sense, most
 people would say that Grapes of Wrath is much more difficult than a simple children's book.

How exactly are Lexile scores calculated? Unfortunately for us, the Lexile Framework
 is the intellectual property of MetaMetrics, the private company that created it, so we can only guess at
 the secret recipe, but it's a pretty good bet that Lexile scores depend on a mixture of the same factors
 used in FleschâKincaid and other open-source readability measures.

Formulas based on surface level text properties and word frequency have clear
 limitations. None of them consider how well organized the information is, or whether the sentences and
 paragraphs are coherent. None consider the role of grammatical tense. None account for the explanation of
 acronyms and jargon. None would balk at Jack Torrance's rambling and meaningless draft in The Shining,
 endlessly repeating âAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.â

But proprietary tech like Lexile has some of the most disconcerting aspects of both
 worlds. As flawed as Flesch-Kincaid or Dale-Chall, but opaque and unexplainable. The main benefit of the F-K
 and D-C formulas (and other simple algorithms like Gunning-Fog and SMOG) is their transparency. A broken
 system locked in a black box can't even offer this.

In recent decades, as disability activists have won more civil rights, both in the [US](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-111publ274) and [internationally](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-21-freedom-of-expression-and-opinion-and-access-to-information.html),
 accessible writing has gained greater attention. And with this attention comes the very real possibility
 that plain language will be outsourced to blackbox technologies that are grounded in antiquated data.

Technology alone isnât the answer. Even the most thoughtful algorithms and robust
 data sets lack context. Ultimately, the effectiveness of plain language translations comes down to
 engagement with your audience. Engagement that doesnât make assumptions about what the audience understands,
 but will instead ask them to find out. Engagement thatâs willing to work directly with people with
 disabilities or limited access to education, and not through intermediaries. As disabled [advocates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTXg9Yki9Eg&ab_channel=aucdnetwork) and [organizations led by
 disabled people](https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/One-Idea-Per-Line.pdf) have been saying all along: âNothing about us without us.â
