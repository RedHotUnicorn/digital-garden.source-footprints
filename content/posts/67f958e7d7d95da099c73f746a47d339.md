How Does the Physiological Sigh Work?
-------------------------------------


While most of the time our breathing is automatic, like digestion and other bodily functions, “you can very easily take over and control your breath, which then affects your overall physiology and stress response,” Spiegel says.


Stressful moments can trigger physical changes like a faster heartbeat, tightened muscles, and sweaty armpits, all of which can lead to spiraling negative thoughts. “As soon as you notice what’s going on in your body, your brain thinks, ‘Oh no, this must be really bad,’ and you get more anxious,” Spiegel explains. “It’s like a snowball rolling downhill.” And for those with anxiety disorders, the feeling can be crushing, making everyday life considerably more difficult.


As [Huberman notes in the above YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc) breaking down the breathing exercise, it allows you to “feel more calm in real time, meaning without having to disengage from the stress-inducing activity.”


The Study
---------


Huberman and Spiegel led a randomized, controlled trial involving 111 volunteers, comparing cyclic sighing to two other types of breathing exercises, one focusing on inhalation and another in which participants were asked to breathe in and out for equal amounts of time. The researchers also had a control group of participants who passively observed their breath during five minutes of mindful meditation.


“In mindfulness meditation, we instruct people to be aware of their breath but not try to control it,” Spiegel says.


Other [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735813000731?via=ihub) have pointed to the benefits of mindful meditation, but it turns out that directly controlling your breath may unlock a more powerful response. In the Stanford [study](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/pdf/S2666-3791(22)00474-8.pdf), published in Cell Reports Medicine, the controlled breathing groups reported even more improvements to their moods, with significant increases in positive affect (feelings like energy, joy, and peacefulness).
