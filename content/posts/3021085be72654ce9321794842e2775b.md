*Note that [official hardware support for macOS 10.15 "Catalina"](https://everymac.com/mac-answers/macos-catalina-faq/macos-catalina-1015-compatible-macs-system-requirements.html) is modestly more limited than it is for [macOS 10.14 "Mojave"](https://everymac.com/mac-answers/macos-mojave-faq/macos-mojave-1014-compatible-macs-system-requirements.html) that came before it. It also drops support for 32-bit apps entirely. Be certain to verify hardware and app compatibility before upgrading an older Hackintosh to this version of the operating system or buying parts for a new system.*


In addition to more limited hardware support, later versions of the macOS do not run 32-bit apps at all, so ***macOS 10.14 "Mojave"*** could be preferable if you have older software. A number of useful tutorials for Mojave include:

Hackintosh Compatible Computers, Parts & Drivers


You can't just install macOS on any old PC and expect it to work like it does on a Mac. Let's face it, given the vast assortment of configurations, you can't install Windows on any old PC and expect it to work like OS X does on a Mac. Fortunately, many have experimented with Mac OS X on a wide variety of PC hardware and have shared their findings with the world. 


The following listings of Hackintosh compatible computers, parts, motherboards and drivers (kexts) should be helpful: 


[DSDT Database](https://www.tonymacx86.com/11-dsdt-database.html) - A database of "Differentiated System Description Tables" to make many motherboards from Asrock, ASUS, EVGA, Gigabyte, Intel and MSI "aware" of Mac OS X. In turn, this is promised to make it possible for the operating system to "utilize more of your hardware" -- from [tonymacx86](https://www.tonymacx86.com/) *(registration required)*. 


[Kext.me](https://kext.me/) - An organized list of kexts, bootloaders, and plugins to make it easier to set up a Hackintosh.


[OS X Compatible Notebooks](https://www.tonymacx86.com/forums/laptop-compatibility.114/) - Recent discussion regarding notebooks from Acer, Alienware, HP, Dell, and others that largely are compatible with recent versions of macOS.


[OSx86 Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20201129195253/http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - An archived copy of the original wiki [no longer online] that once listed desktop and notebook computers, as well as parts, that were compatible with some older versions of Mac OS X.

[Mac OS X Netbook Compatibility Chart](https://web.archive.org/web/20160806085201/http://www.mymacnetbook.com:80/compatibility-chart/) - This archived copy of a Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard compatibility chart of dozens of netbooks from my Mac Netbook (no longer online) can be particularly useful for those interested in "legacy" Mac OS X use.

Hackintosh Support Communities


There are a number of vibrant and active communities that focus on helping one another to configure, build, and troubleshoot Hackintosh systems. Notable Hackintosh communities such as the following may be useful to you: 


Before posting a message in any of these forums, it always is good form to first search and see whether or not your question has been addressed previously. Those who do not do so can expect to be dismissed as "noobs" or ignored.
