Анализ GPT-4 интервью с региональным менеджером
===============================================

Александр Белов  
**Идея**. Я участвовал в конкурсе Yandex Datalens Festival 2022, а недавно Роман разобрал конкурсный кейс оттуда на мероприятии Yandex Cloud. Во время просмотра меня осенило: интервью можно расшифровать, потом суммировать с помощью GPT-4, опираясь на блоки Dashboard Canvas 2.0, а еще подобрать графики и задать дополнительные вопросы.

**Итог**: если правильно настроить нейросеть на анализ интервью и выделение из него главного по заданным ранее правилам, в нашем случае Dashboard Canvas, то определенно можно упростить себе задачу формирования бизнес-потребностей заказчиков. Хотя GPT-4 хорошо суммирует, она может что-то упускать, все равно приходится надеяться только на себя. Больше пользы видится в автоматизации интервью с помощью нейронных сетей, когда они становятся интервьюером, знают, что спросить и могут адаптироваться по ходу, а после этого способны заполнить какие-либо формы – разумеется, нейронная сеть должна говорить с заказчиком, и не просто распознавать его речь, но и анализировать на ходу – эти продукты существуют по отдельности, думаю, осталось недолго до их появления и полноценного использования в рабочих процессах.

### Диалог с GPT-4:

*Вопрос к модели выделен* ***жирным курсивом****.*

***Okay. You have full interview. Now I ask you questions. This result will help us to create a dashboard. Answer my question using this interview. We create dashboard for regional manager Лена***

***Q: Who will be using the dashboard?***

***A:***

***Q: What is this dashboard needed for?***

***A:***

***Q: What are the main metrics for this dashboard?***

***A:***

***Q: In what sections should the data be shown?***

***A:***

***Q: What is the data source?***

***A:***

***Q: What are the problems the regional manager wants to solve? (i.e., business needs)***

***A:***

Based on the interview, here are the answers to your questions:

Q: Who will be using the dashboard?

A: The dashboard will primarily be used by the regional managers, including Лена. Additionally, the logistics team will also have access to the dashboard as they need to monitor the delivery of goods.

Q: What is this dashboard needed for?

A: The dashboard is needed to monitor and analyze key performance indicators related to sales and delivery in the region. It will help the regional managers plan advertising campaigns, schedule meetings with logistics if necessary, and quickly identify and address any issues or deviations in the metrics.

Q: What are the main metrics for this dashboard?

A: The main metrics for this dashboard include sales volume (in rubles and in the number of orders), average check per order, the number of canceled orders, the number of delivered orders, and average delivery time in days. Additionally, they are interested in the percentage of canceled and delivered orders, and the distribution of delivery times.

Q: In what sections should the data be shown?

A: The data should be shown in sections corresponding to the main metrics. This includes sections for sales data, order data, cancellation and delivery percentages, and delivery time distribution. There should also be a section for detailed data down to the order level, allowing the regional managers to dig into the data and identify any anomalies or specific cases.

Q: What is the data source?

A: Лена mentioned that she would provide access to the data after the call. The exact source isn't specified in the interview, but it's implied that the data is already collected and stored in a system accessible to the BI developer.

Q: What are the problems the regional manager wants to solve? (i.e., business needs)

A: The regional manager wants to monitor the performance of the region in terms of sales and delivery, identify any significant deviations or issues, and take corrective actions as necessary. She also wants to plan advertising campaigns based on the top-selling categories and products. Additionally, she wants to compare her region's performance with other similar regions to understand the relative performance. Lastly, she wants to be able to dig into the data at a detailed level to understand specific cases, especially when there are issues with delivery times or cancellations.

***What about issues? When Лена should worried about KPIs?***

Based on the interview, Лена should be concerned about the following situations:

1. **Sales Drop:** If there's a drop in sales of more than 20% week over week, it's considered a critical deviation that requires immediate attention and factor analysis to understand the cause.
2. **Delivery Time Increase:** An increase in the average delivery time of more than 10% is also a critical deviation that needs immediate attention and analysis.
3. **High Cancellation Rate:** While a specific threshold isn't mentioned in the interview, a high percentage of canceled orders could indicate problems with the products or the delivery process.
4. **Comparison with Similar Regions:** If the performance metrics of her region significantly deviate from the average of similar regions, it could indicate potential issues that need to be addressed.

In all these situations, the dashboard should ideally provide a way for Лена to drill down into the data and understand the underlying causes, so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken.

***What about categories of products?***

In terms of product categories, Лена and her team focus on the top 5 categories with the highest average check. Within these categories, they identify the top 3 most frequently sold products based on the number of orders. These products are then targeted for special promotions or advertising campaigns.

The categories used for this analysis are at the second level of the marketplace's category hierarchy. This level of detail allows them to focus on specific types of products without getting too granular or too broad.

If there are significant changes in the sales or order volumes of these top categories or products, it could indicate a shift in customer preferences or potential issues with the products or their delivery. In such cases, Лена would need to investigate further and take appropriate actions.

***What charts would you recommend for these metrics and for all what we discussed after interview?***

Based on the metrics and requirements discussed in the interview, here are some chart recommendations:

1. **Sales Volume (in rubles and number of orders):** A line chart would be suitable for tracking sales volume over time. This can help identify trends and patterns, and spot any significant changes or anomalies.
2. **Average Check per Order:** A bar chart or line chart could be used to track the average check per order over time. This can help identify any changes in customer spending habits.
3. **Number of Canceled Orders:** A line chart could be used to track the number of canceled orders over time. This can help identify any issues with the products or the ordering process.
4. **Number of Delivered Orders:** A line chart could be used to track the number of delivered orders over time. This can help monitor the efficiency of the delivery process.
5. **Average Delivery Time:** A line chart could be used to track the average delivery time over time. This can help identify any issues or delays in the delivery process.
6. **Percentage of Canceled and Delivered Orders:** A pie chart or a stacked bar chart could be used to show the proportion of orders that are delivered and canceled. This can provide a quick overview of the order fulfillment status.
7. **Distribution of Delivery Times:** A histogram could be used to show the distribution of delivery times. This can help identify any issues with the delivery process and monitor its efficiency.
8. **Top 5 Categories with Highest Average Check and Top 3 Products:** A bar chart could be used to show the top categories and products based on sales volume or average check. This can help identify the most popular and profitable items.
9. **Sales Drop and Delivery Time Increase Alerts:** These could be represented as indicators or gauges on the dashboard that change color (e.g., turn red) when the specified thresholds are exceeded.
10. **Comparison with Similar Regions:** A line chart or bar chart could be used to compare the performance metrics of the region with the average of similar regions. This can help identify relative performance and potential issues.

Remember, the goal is to present the data in a way that is easy to understand and actionable. The exact choice of charts may depend on the specific BI tool used and the preferences of the users.

***As a result what questions do you recommend to ask stakeholders? (здесь модель не поняла, что я хотел получить вопросы, которые нужно всегда задавать, она решила, что нужны дополнительные вопросы, которые не были заданы, но так даже интересней получилось)***

Based on the conversation and the requirements gathered, here are some additional questions that could be asked to the stakeholders:

1. **Data Access and Quality:** Can you provide more details about the data source? How is the data quality, and are there any known issues or limitations with the data that we should be aware of?
2. **Specific Metrics:** Are there any other specific metrics or KPIs that you track regularly and would like to see on the dashboard?
3. **User Preferences:** Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for how the data should be presented? For example, are there certain types of charts or visualizations that you find particularly useful or easy to understand?
4. **Alerts and Notifications:** Would you like to have any alerts or notifications set up for certain conditions, such as a significant drop in sales or an increase in delivery time?
5. **Data Drill-Down:** How detailed would you like the drill-down functionality to be? For example, would you like to be able to see details at the order level, customer level, product level, etc.?
6. **Dashboard Access:** Who else, besides the regional managers and logistics team, will need access to the dashboard? Are there any specific access controls or permissions that need to be set up?
7. **Dashboard Updates:** How frequently should the dashboard be updated? Do you need real-time updates, or would daily or weekly updates be sufficient?
8. **Training Needs:** Would you or your team need any training or support to use the dashboard effectively?
9. **Feedback Mechanism:** How would you like to provide feedback on the dashboard once it's developed? Would you prefer to have regular review meetings, or would you like to provide feedback via email or some other method?
10. **Future Enhancements:** Are there any features or capabilities that you would like to add to the dashboard in the future? This could help us design the dashboard in a way that makes it easier to add these features later on.
