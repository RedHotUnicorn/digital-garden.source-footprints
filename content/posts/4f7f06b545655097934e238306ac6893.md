 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=0)~~  Journaling has seen a majorresurgence in recent years. Studies keep coming out not onlyabout the mental, but physical health benefits of journaling. That said, the idea of starting ajournal can seem daunting to some. It looks like it takes a lot of time,requires artistic talent, a lot of pens, and is emotionally draining. True. It can be all of these things,but it really doesn't have to be. It can be much easier. Hi, I'm Ryder, creator of The Bullet. Journal Method, and today I'm gonna showyou how you can quickly start a minimal but very powerful journaling practice. Let's begin. Let's begin by briefly discussing whatyou should write about in your journal before we talk about how to journal. You can journal about anything, butI think it's important to have an intention to anchor your practice around. I made a video about this that you cancheck out here, but the short version is before you start journaling, ask yourselfwhat do you wanna get out of journaling? What makes you curiousabout this practice? Clarity organization, calmness,being less forgetful, better 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=64)~~  mental health, self-awareness. There are no wrong answers here. Just something that really speaks to you. Take a moment to think about it. See if you can write it downin one or two sentences. This intention will provide the lens andthe purpose for your journaling practice. Without a purpose, yourpractice can feel meaningless. Don't worry, you can alwayschange it again later as you start getting the hang of it. Next, let's take a look at how you cancapture your thoughts using a technique I invented called rapid logging. Let me ask you a question. What was the last meaningfulthing somebody said? Or something a bit easier. What did you have for lunch two days ago? If you can't remember, you're not alone. We can't rely on our memory toaccurately capture our experiences, but experiences are incredibly valuable. Experiences, whether they'regood or bad, are lessons. Writing down our thoughts, feelings,and experience gives us an opportunity to study them and to understand thelesson that they're trying to teach us. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=126)~~  The problem is that our livesare infinitely complex with countless things to keep track of. Rapid Logging solves this issue byhelping you organize your thinking into one of three main categories of thought. Things you need to do, your tasks. Things you experience, events. And things you don'twant to forget, notes. Each category has its own symbol tohelp upgrade a basic bulleted list into one with more context and function. These symbols will allow you to quicklycapture and contextualize your thoughts in real time throughout the day. It will also help you scan yourpage edges and quickly find what you're looking for later on. Let's cover the basicsof each bullet type. The task Bullet is representedas a dot, making it faster, cleaner, and more flexible touse than a traditional checkbox. Our tasks have different states. They begin, they pause,they end, they resume, they move. That's another reason why we use a dot. It can be easily transformed toreflect various states of a task. An open task starts as a dot. Once it's completed,it's turned into an X. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=191)~~  If you need to move a task elsewherein your notebook, that dot turns into an arrow pointing in the directionyou move that item in your notebook. If a task is no longerneeded, you can strike it out. If a task requires multiplesteps to complete it can be laid out as a master task with manysub-tasks nested beneath it. This way, you can quickly break down atask into smaller, more manageable steps. This also turns that taskinto a little progress bar. As you make your way through. Events are representedby the circle bullet. These are experience related entries. You can use them to write down thingsbefore they happen, but I usually use them to write things after that happened,just to create a record of the event. For example, if you wanna write downsomething that you already did, it would not be a task, it would be an event. This can help you keep trackof your actions that you didn't plan to do ahead of time. When logging experienceswe want to keep it simple. Rather than trying to capture theemotional complexity of an experience, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=258)~~  simply write down what you observed. Last day of work. Big fight today, closed on house. We write things down thisway, not because we're robots. We do this because it's faster andeasier, which increases the likelihood that we will actually write itdown and keep writing down events. This helps keep our record more completeand accurate over the long term. With that said, if you wanna unpack anexperience through longer form journaling, I recommend doing it in the next day ortwo while it's still fresh in your mind. The other option is to pair the eventbullet with the final bullet type Notes are represented with a dash. Notes can be facts, ideas,thoughts, observations, and. The purpose of the note bulletis to capture noteworthy information that isn't actionable. This bullet lends itself well toclasses, meetings, as well as emotions. Notes can also be nested under tasksand events to capture important details. This is a quick way to add color andcontext to your entries, like your biggest takeaways or any strong feelingsthat were present during the time. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=324)~~  Big or small everything wedo, everything we experience provokes some emotional response. The notes bullet lets usquickly capture those responses. Over time a record of those responsescan help us correlate how we feel with what we do and what we experience. As you can see, there's a surprisingamount of information that becomes available to us by triangulatingthese three types of thought. Of course, there are manytypes of thoughts and there are more types of states, andthat's what signifiers are for. Signifiers can be used toprovide additional contact. Set a glance. These are placed to the left of thebullets, making them easy to notice. Two examples of signifiers that I useare an asterisk for priorities and an exclamation mark for inspiration or ideas. This way I can quickly find what's mostimportant to me while scanning my pages. Okay, let's put this all together. To set up a minimal buteffective journaling practice start by saying in intention. This will help you frame your thoughtsand give your practice purpose. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHGtMw-JFRU&t=391)~~  Then throughout the day, writedown the things you need to do, the things you don't wanna forget,and the things that you experience. Write them down as short, bulletedsentences, so you'll make it more likely that you continueto keep logging these things. And that's really it. Simply by implementing these twosteps, you've created a powerful foundation for a journaling practice. You now have the tools you need to quicklyoffload information throughout the day. And once you do that, you'releft with a clear, categorized list of prioritized thoughts. Over time, this will create avery accurate record of what worked, what didn't, what you wantmore of, what you want less of. Cultivating this type of self-awarenessthrough journaling will allow you to make choices that areinformed by your lived experience. This is just the tip of the iceberg of it.
