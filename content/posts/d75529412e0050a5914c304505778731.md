What background color should your data vis have?

*Hi, this is Lisa! I’m responsible for the communications at Datawrapper and have been fairly busy writing a book about colors in data vis in the past months. Today: background colors.*


Once you become more confident with colors, colorful backgrounds can seem like an exciting idea. They can make your chart **feel more designed** — and they are huge **brand identifiers.** If I see a chart with a  [pink](https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/that-indescribable-pink-of-the-financial-times/) background **⬤** anywhere on the internet, I immediately know it’s from the Financial Times.


But backgrounds come with drawbacks. If they’re very colorful, they can distract from your data — and you’ll have fewer choices when it comes to the actual colors for your chart elements. 


I was curious: Which colors do data vis designers use for their visualizations (if they use any at all)? Let’s have a look. Here’s a scatterplot that shows **which background colors a few big and well-known organizations use** for all of their charts. 


This chart doesn't tell us anything about the hue (is the background yellow? blue? green?), but only about saturation (on the y-axis) and lightness (on the x-axis). We can see, for example, that The Economist has a background color now **⬤** that's **brighter** and **less saturated** than before **⬤**. The difference becomes more obvious when we give the background colors more space. Here's an image from visual journalist Sarah Leo's wonderful article ["Mistakes, we've drawn a few"](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368):

Let's fill the scatter plot with a few more data visualizations. I wanted to include **visualizations from more and less advanced people** in data visualization — so besides award winners and professional organizations, I also added data visualizations that got submitted to **platforms that focus on learning** within a community. Here they are:


* **[Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?action=index&award=2019&controller=showcase&page=1&pcategory=short-list&type=awards)** winners. The last one happened in 2019, so these visualizations are a bit older.
* [**The Pudding**](https://pudding.cool/) visualizations. This publication uses a looot of different backgrounds — in fact, of the 31 stories with charts that they put out between May 2020 and today, 19 had a colorful background.
* **[Storytelling with Data challenge](https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges/mar-2022-qualitative-data)** entries: I added the 17 (of 92) visualizations with a colorful background that the community submitted for the "qualitative data" challenge in March 2022.
* [**Iron Viz 2022**](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/blog/2022/02/explore-iron-viz-entries-visualizing-arts) entries: It felt like every second visualization had a pure black background, so I didn't include them anymore after a certain point. I did include the 45 out of 198 visualizations that had a color other than #000000 or pure white as the background color.


With these 100 new data points, our scatter plots looks like this:


Ok, let's unpack that.


First, we can see that most visualizations use very bright backgrounds. And some visualizations use fairly dark colors. But very few use colors that are somewhere in between. **Not a single visualization from the advanced organizations had a medium-bright color as its background.** That's because it's hard to find good colors to go on top of them: They would need to be either very dark or very bright to have a good lightness contrast to the background. 


Something else we see: **Most background colors are not very saturated.** The reason is similar: It's hard to find colors that go with a very colorful background. In most cases, you want the background to recede, not to scream "look at me!".


Apropos of "recede": During my research, I noticed that people who are still learning about data visualization tend to make the background pure black (#000000). More advanced people, on the other hand, soften their dark backgrounds by making them **dark gray**. These dark grays still looks black. But they're less intense, and a bit more sophisticated. 


If we **zoom in on the bright backgrounds**, we'll get another insight: 


Most of the visualizations — especially from advanced data vis designers — use a **warm background color like yellow or orange**. The Economist visualizations with their blue backgrounds are actually an outlier. 


So we can conclude: **Your background color should be desaturated, and either very bright or very dark.**If you want to be sure, use a **warm, very bright, desaturated** background color.

*I hope you enjoyed this little exploration of data vis background colors! If you're wondering why I didn't use the more common HSV or HSL color spaces instead of that weird OKLCH one, [head over to my daily book updates for a charty explanation](https://www.notion.so/datawrapper/June-30-f9a79619534b4cec97a6a7368824dd99). We'll see you next week!*
