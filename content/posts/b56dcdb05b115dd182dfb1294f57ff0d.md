The Fundamental Attribution Error
=================================

The fundamental attribution error is the attribution of the source of behaviour to the character and personality of a person above the consideration of context. It's sometimes described as over-attributing causes to disposition over situation.

In a classic example, if a driver swerves in front of you suddenly, it's easy to attribute the cause of the behaviour to the driver being a jerk, i.e. to their character. What we may not see is that the driver is late to pick up their kids, was distracted by a challenging conversation they just had at work, and they're worried they've gone the wrong way and are driving an unfamiliar car.

[If a colleague is late to meet us](https://sketchplanations.com/the-cost-of-being-late), we might infer that the person is lazy or disrespectful when, in fact, they may have been held up by a traffic accident, been on the phone with a sick relative, and have had trouble sleeping lately. If *we* are late for a meeting, well, then it's probably for all sorts of good reasons outside our control.

Like [confirmation bias](https://sketchplanations.com/confirmation-bias), the fundamental attribution error is a big one that can easily colour our interactions with others without us being aware of it.

Some ways to minimise it include:

* Remember that what we see is just a tiny fraction of any other person's life and that we don't see the complete picture.
* Minimise judgment, particularly around character and personality.
* Avoid jumping to conclusions.
* Where appropriate, ask if anything is bothering others.
* Build empathy for others as you would for yourself.
* Reflect on the positive things others do.
