How do you improve resting heart rate?Summary of top 8 papersResting heart rate is an important indicator of cardiovascular health and risk. Several studies have found that lowering resting heart rate can have benefits for heart health and longevity (Husmann 2011). Exercise training is one way to achieve a lower resting heart rate. Choe 2015 found that certain video processing techniques can improve the accuracy of measuring resting heart rate. Loimaala 2000 found that 5 months of moderate exercise training lowered resting heart rate, though### View sources for every answer

âA meta-analysis of 30 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials concluded that fish oil consumption can significantly reduce heart rate (Mozaffarian 2005). In particular, the effect was greater in people whose baseline heart rate was higher: in the overall pooled estimate, fish oil decreased heart rate by 1.6 bpm compared to placebo, but reduced heart rate by 2.5 bpm in trials with a median baseline heart rate of â¥ 69 bpm. Furthermore, the ability of fish oil to reduce heart rate appeared to depend on the length of treatment.### Ask questions to papers

Ask a questionWhat was the effect size in the first trial arm?
The effect size in the first trial arm is a marked reduction in spectral power in the ultra low frequency band for both heart rate variability and EMG when going from active to rest conditions, as well as significant changes in mean heart rate and EMG activity between the active and rest days. Additionally, there was a significant sex-by-activity interaction in the high frequency band of the RR interval power.Research for the machine intelligence age

### How do researchers use Elicit?


Over 2 million researchers have used Elicit. Researchers commonly use Elicit to: 

* Speed up literature review
* Find papers they couldnât find elsewhere
* Automate systematic reviews and meta-analyses
* Learn about a new domain

Elicit tends to work best for empirical domains that involve experiments and concrete results. This type of research is common in biomedicine and machine learning.

### What is Elicit not a good fit for?


Elicit does not currently answer questions or surface information that is not written about in an academic paper. It tends to work less well for identifying facts (e.g. âHow many cars were sold in Malaysia last year?â) and theoretical or non-empirical domains.  


### What types of data can Elicit search over?


Elicit searches across 125 million academic papers from the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.com/)  


### How accurate are the answers in Elicit?


A good rule of thumb is to assume that around 90% of the information you see in Elicit is accurate. While we do our best to increase accuracy without skyrocketing costs, itâs very important for you to check the work in Elicit closely. We try to make this easier for you by identifying all of the sources for information generated with language models.  


### What is Elicit Plus?


Elicit Plus is Elicit's subscription offering, which comes with a set of features, as well as monthly credits. On Elicit Plus, you may use up to 12,000 credits a month. Unused monthly credits do not carry forward into the next month. Plus subscriptions auto-renew every month.  


### What are credits?


Elicit uses a credit system to pay for the costs of running our app. When you run workflows and add columns to tables it will cost you credits. When you sign up you get 5,000 credits to use. Once those run out, you'll need to subscribe to Elicit Plus to get more. Credits are non-transferable.  


### How can you get in contact with the team?


Please email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31585f575e71545d585258451f525e5c)[Slack community](https://elicit.com/link/slack)[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bfd7dad3cfffdad3d6dcd6cb91dcd0d2) and we will try to help you as soon as possible.  


### What happens to papers uploaded to Elicit?


When you upload papers to analyze in Elicit, those papers will remain private to you and will not be shared with anyone else.  


How accurate is Elicit?
-----------------------

Elicit uses language models to extract data from and summarize research papers. As a new technology, language models sometimes make up inaccurate answers.  
We improve accuracy by:  
### Training our models on specific tasks

We fine-tune our models on a per-task basis and constantly iterate to make them more accurate.  
### Searching over academic papers

Elicit only shows you papers that actually exist and are part of the scientific literature.  
### Making it easy to double-check answers

We make it easy for you to view the original source and point to where in a paper specific information came from.  
Save time, think more.
