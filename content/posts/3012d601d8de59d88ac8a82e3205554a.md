Tableau Tip Tuesday: Table Calculations Overview
================================================


[20 comments](https://www.vizwiz.com/2017/02/table-calcs.html#comment-form)


Table calcs - the beast of all things Tableau...for me at least! It's been nearly 10 years that I've been using Tableau and it wasn't until I was teaching last week that the light bulb went off.  

  

  

  

1. Provide recommendations for how to approach table calcs
2. Teach you how to read table calcs in a plain English sentence



Here are two slides I created to help you read table calcs:

The trick is to read from the bottom up.  

  

1. Start with the unchecked boxes and add the words "For each" before those.
2. Move to the Calculation type and add the words "compute the" before the item in the Calculation Type box.
3. Add the word "by" before each box that is checked at the bottom, again reading it from bottom to top.




I hope you find this helpful and that it makes table calculations easier for you to understand. Please let me know if this helps.
