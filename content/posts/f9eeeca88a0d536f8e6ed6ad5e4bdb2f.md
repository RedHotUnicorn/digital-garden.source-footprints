After a thorough benchmark of available options, we decided to switch from a legacy solution to Lago as they proved to offer the strongest product, as the team has a deep understanding of hybrid monetization streams.![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/635119506e36baf5c267fecd/65ec946d6f5f3a0c51b052a0_166f17cdb1b834c30fcf04aad35a0800.jpg)Nicolas Saison

Payments and billing create huge underrated nightmares for engineers. With their open-source approach, Lago can help solve the long tail of challenges. Lago provides a solid foundation for Billing engineers to build on and customize to their needs. The team is super reactive and experienced in the space too!![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/635119506e36baf5c267fecd/6355757b41400e56eecaa759_testimonial-github-joel-taylor.png)Joel Taylor

We've revamped our billing stack three times and even went through a failed implementation with Zuora. We totally underestimated the complexity of billing at the time, and our needs were too specific for closed-source vendors.![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/635119506e36baf5c267fecd/6355757be4103158257cbe49_testimonial-algolia-nicolas-dessaigne.png)Nicolas Dessaigne

The problemMetering and billing are still nightmares
-----------------------------------------

Numerous edge cases. Constant pricing changes. Looming scalability issues.

### For Engineers

Have all the edge cases been covered? Metering per second, pre-aggregation, data clean-up, custom plans, scalability for growth... There are too many topics to list them all.

### For Revenue leaders

The average startup sees a 20% bump in ARR when iterating on pricing\*. Donât let your metering and billing system prevent you from improving your pricing and increasing ARR.

### For Finance teams

Clunky data reprocessing, invoicing mistakes, tedious reporting tasks and above all, the anxiety of having missed another detail that had to be addressed manually.

The solutionComposable metering and billing
-------------------------------

Usage monitoring### Plug-and-play metering

Tired of pre-aggregating and cleaning data, so that it can be used for billing? Skip this step. Connect your data sources to Lago, as they are, and weâll take care of the rest.

Our billing product includes a first-class API for engineers and a pixel-perfect user interface for business teams. Everything we build, you wonât have to build yourself: subscription, usage computations, billing cycles, dates, currencies, etc.

More control### Composability and security

Weâre open-source, so itâs not âbuy Lago or build it yourselfâ, thereâs a third option: you can build on top of Lago. Audit our code and keep your data within your infrastructure, if you want full control.
