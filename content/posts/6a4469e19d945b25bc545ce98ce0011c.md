> Gephi is the leading visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks. Gephi is open-source and free.

¬øWhat is Gephi?
===============

Gephi is a tool for data analysts and scientists keen to explore and understand graphs. Like Photoshop‚Ñ¢ but for graph data, the user interacts with the representation, manipulate the structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden patterns. The goal is to help data analysts to make hypothesis, intuitively discover patterns, isolate structure singularities or faults during data sourcing. It is a complementary tool to traditional statistics, as visual thinking with interactive interfaces is now recognized to facilitate reasoning. This is a software for Exploratory Data Analysis, a paradigm appeared in the Visual Analytics field of research.

**Architecture**

The modular architecture allows developers adding and extending features with ease by developing plug-ins. Gephi can also be used as Java library in other applications and build for instance, a layout server.

![]()**Plugins**
===========

The built-in Plugins Center automatically gets the list of plugins available from the Gephi Plugin portal and takes care of all software updates. There are dozens of community-built plugins that extends Gephi‚Äôs functionalities.
