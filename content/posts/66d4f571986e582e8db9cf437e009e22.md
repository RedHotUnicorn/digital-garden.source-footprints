Usage
-----


### How to use


See [Usage](/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker/blob/main/docs/Usage.md) for details.


### How to configure


Task Marker uses [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) to format the date and time to be appended. In addition, **square brackets** are needed to surround the content that is not part of the format string.


* For example, if `[completion::2023-01-01]` is the desired text to be appended, then `[[completion::]YYYY-MM-DD[]]` needs to be configured in settings.


See [Setting](/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker/blob/main/docs/Setting.md) for more detailed settings.

Install the plugin from the Obsidian Community Plugins store:


1. Go to `Settings > Community plugins` and disable "Restricted mode"
2. Click "Browse" to search for plugins and type "task marker"
3. Select **Task Marker** and click "Install"
