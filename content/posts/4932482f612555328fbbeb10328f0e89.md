SilverBullet
============


SilverBullet is a note-taking application optimized for people with a [hacker mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker). We all take notes. There’s a million note taking applications out there. [Literally](https://www.noteapps.ca/). Wouldn’t it be nice to have one where your notes are *more* than plain text files? Where your notes essentially become a *database* that you can query; that you can build custom knowledge applications on top of? A *hackable notebook*, if you will?


This is what SilverBullet aims to be.


Absolutely. You use SilverBullet to quickly jot things down. It’s a notes app after all. However, this is just the beginning. Gradually, you start to annotate your notes using [Frontmatter](https://silverbullet.md/Frontmatter). You realize: “Hey, this note represents a *person*, let me [tag](https://silverbullet.md/Tags) it as such.” Before you know it, you’re turning your notes into [Objects](https://silverbullet.md/Objects). Then you learn that in SilverBullet you can [Live Query](https://silverbullet.md/Live%20Queries) these objects. Your queries grow into reusable [Templates](https://silverbullet.md/Templates) written using a powerful [Template Language](https://silverbullet.md/Template%20Language). You find more and more uses of these templates, for instance to create [new pages](https://silverbullet.md/Page%20Templates), or [widgets](https://silverbullet.md/Live%20Template%20Widgets) automatically added to your pages.


And then, before you know it — you realize you’re effectively building applications in your notes app. [End-User Programming](https://silverbullet.md/End-User%20Programming), y’all. It’s cool.


You may have been told there is *no such thing* as a [silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet).


You were told wrong.

Features
--------


SilverBullet...


* Runs in any modern browser (including on mobile) as a PWA in two Client Modes (*online* and *synced* mode), where the *synced mode* enables **100% offline operation**, keeping a copy of content in the browser, syncing back to the server when a network connection is available.
* Provides an enjoyable markdown writing experience with a clean UI, rendering text using Live Preview, further **reducing visual noise** while still providing direct access to the underlying markdown syntax.
* Supports wiki-style **page linking** using the `[[page link]]` syntax. Incoming links are indexed and appear as “Linked Mentions” at the bottom of the pages linked to thereby providing *bi-directional linking*.
* Optimized for **keyboard-based operation**:
	+ Quickly navigate between pages using the **page switcher** (triggered with `Cmd-k` on Mac or `Ctrl-k` on Linux and Windows).
	+ Run commands via their keyboard shortcuts or the **command palette** (triggered with `Cmd-/` or `Ctrl-/` on Linux and Windows).
	+ Use Slash Commands to perform common text editing operations.
* Provides a platform for [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/) through its support for Objects, Live Queries and Live Templates.
* Robust extension mechanism using plugs.
* **Self-hosted**: you own your data. All content is stored as plain files in a folder on disk. Back up, sync, edit, publish, script with any additional tools you like.
* SilverBullet is [open source, MIT licensed](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet) software.

Developing SilverBullet
-----------------------

SilverBullet is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
built on top of the excellent [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) editor
component. Additional UI is built using [Preact](https://preactjs.com).
ESBuild is used to build both the front-end and
back-end bundles. The server backend runs as a HTTP server on Deno using and is written using [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/).


To prepare the initial web and plug build run:



```
deno task build
```

To symlink `silverbullet` to your locally checked-out version, run:



```
deno task install
```

You can then run the server in “watch mode” (automatically restarting when you
change source files) with:



```
deno task watch-server <PATH-TO-YOUR-SPACE>
```

After this initial build, it's convenient to run three commands in parallel (in
separate terminals):



```
deno task watch-web
deno task watch-server <PATH-TO-YOUR-SPACE>
deno task watch-plugs
```

To typecheck the entire codebase (recommended before submitting PR):



```
deno task check
```

To run unit tests:



```
deno task test
```
