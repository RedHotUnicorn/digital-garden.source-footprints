Securely share your Obsidian notes with one click.

End-to-end encrypted
--------------------


Your notes are stored securely using strong **AES-256-CBC encryption**. The decryption key is never sent to the server, so not even the server can open your
 notes.

Zero configuration
------------------


Other plugins require integration with GitHub Gist or Notion using your API keys.
 Noteshare.space is a **dedicated service** for sharing
 your Markdown notes. No account is needed to use our service.
