**Carefully now!** You might accidentally download the installer!

  

But seriously, take a moment to read through the following information before proceeding with the download:


* - If you have any questions about the application or want to stay updated on news and updates, join [Telegram channel.](https://t.me/wladblog)
* - To utilize the GPU version, [CUDA 11.8 must be installed](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive). The GPU version offers significantly faster processing speeds compared to the CPU version.


  

**Automatic Dependency Installation**


For Windows users, all dependencies, including the ffmpeg library, will be automatically installed. However, if you prefer a manual installation, you can download ffmpeg from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add the installation path to the environment variable:


  

**Installer**


Download the installer **wunjo\_{version}.msi** or portable version archive.


  

**Sample Files**


In order to test that the models have been successfully downloaded, you can use the [example files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru/main/example) on GitHub.


  

**Important Notices**


* - When launching neural synthesis for the first time, the necessary models will be downloaded. If prompted by your firewall, ensure you allow the application to connect to the network. Alternatively, you can manually install all models as outlined in our documentation on [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru/wiki).
* - Watch [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJG0sD6007zFJyV78mkU-KW2UxbirgTGr) for installing the application on Windows or how you can use API.
* - If you encounter issues with working some modules, it's possible that the models lack read permissions. Navigate to the `.wunjo` directory, open the console, and enter the following command:


  

**Additional Tips**


* - Verify your [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installation on your computer.
* - Clear cache and output files in: `%USERPROFILE%/.wunjo`
* - If you encounter issues with Kaspersky, refer to briefcase [issue 1530](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1530) for more details. Alternatively, consider installing the application on a virtual machine or performing briefcase development without creating a briefcase build. Access the project code on [GitHub](https://github.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru).
