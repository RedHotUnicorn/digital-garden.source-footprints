Seterra Map Quiz - What's Your World Geography IQ?   
  
Whether you're studying for final exams or Final Jeopardy, Seterra has the geography category covered. The popular online and desktop based map quiz classic that has been entertaining and educating geography buffs ages 8-88 for more than 20 years has gone mobile.
