# Description 
This video has been upgraded and replaced by a new expanded Pillars overview at https://youtu.be/mEb_NFetcwU

I recommend skipping this one and watching that one (if watching in sequence, watch that one now and come back to your place in sequence afterward).
_________
In this video we look at Life Pillars in Notion â€” the top peak of the Pillars-to-Pipelines Pyramid we've been building in the Alignment Dashboard. We look at how this Notion database helps is align all aspects of our life and keeps us on track, ensuring our lives are in order and able to grow in the direction we choose.

 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=0)~~  Hi everyone, welcome back to our ongoing serieson how to create a life operating system in notion today, we're going to look at pillars,pillars are super important, we've come a long way, we started looking at tasks withthe task database in a daily action zone, then we looked at projects, we looked at Goal,outcomes, and value goals, and now we're working away up the pillar to pipeline pyramid whichis the fundamental core concept of the alignment zone alignment on, is the dashboard in thesystem that aligns the high level aspirations and identity elements of who you are and whoyou wanna be with the low level daily actions, what you do hour-to-hour, and day-to-day andmake sure that those actions at the minute, specific level, add up to what you want toachieve ultimately over time in your life and in your family, and in your business andall that. So this is how it's done today we're workingon the pillars pillars toward the very top of the pillar to pipeline pyramid which isthe alignment structure everything flows from 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=60)~~  the pillars to the goals to the projects. To the tasks, so you've gotta have the rightpillars in place because everything you do across the goals projects and tasks is inservice of a specific pillar so you need this intentionality that's a very deliberate understandingof what you're working toward, and that's what today's video is all about... And then we're going to do the video, thatties it all together with the extremely important reviews where I call "the cycle reviews, wehave the weekly review, in the monthly review at a very minimum, and sometimes for someelements, the quarterly review depending on how you structure your system, those reviewcycles pull everything together and keep everything on track. So that video come very shortly, but todaywe're finishing off the pillar to pipeline pyramid after the last several videos, solet's dive in. So jumping off from the command center, ourtop level dashboard, we're going to go into the alignment zone as we've done the pastseveral videos early on, we looked at the 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=115)~~  task database, which is what I call the actionitems here. We recently looked at the project databasethe goals pipeline which includes the value goals database. And the goal, outcomes, database and todaywe're looking at the life pillars, the pillars database in the Pillar support. So, I, when we open this up we see a databasein notion in a table view, this is filtered, just by everything that's active. You do have a status over here on the farright? It's either active pastor inactive, so I prettymuch... Everything tends to be active. I mean, there's no point of it even beinga pillar if it's not active, but should you have something that you might wanna get toeventually or if you've just grown and changed, and something that was active isn't... Don't delete it, just either pause it if youthink it might be temporary or make it inactive if you're not gonna use it much. Jumping back here, this is everything thatit's active, and I've organized these items by three types. We've got growth business and home life. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=163)~~  So growth would be things like learning andhealth and fitness business would be things like client execution branding and audiencebusiness admin, business admins, kind of a catch-all. They're gonna be lots of little things, billsto pay book-keeping and taxes and little things that you need a bit of a catch-all for justoperating your business. If you don't do them, your world can becomechaotic, it can become a mess. So it's important, it's not the most excitingstuff, but it is important that pillars are all about keeping the roof up the lights onyour world an order, if all of these things are taking care of your world will be an order. So that is the objective year. So giving some more example, sales and marketingwould be part of business product development as part of business. And then home life, I have home maintenance,the household managing the household family. So this is all about interacting with peoplein my family. Then personal admin, which similar to, asbusiness admin was sort a catch-all for the 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=215)~~  little maintenance things in business in personalthere are a lot of... A little maintenance things but also to meit's a little bit bigger and that it would include membership groups that I'm a partof social stuff with friends. It all falls into of administrating my personalactivities, aside from family. And home management. Now, those of you who have been with the seriesfrom the beginning, will notice we've got three categories here, a growth business,home life that corresponds to the command center, which is our top level dashboard sortof our entry way to the entire system. This was the first section specific videowe did, and we talked about how there's a focus, and alignment, column for diving intothe areas that we're really executing on focus on alignment. Those are the most active dashboards in thesystem. Then we have a separate column for each ofgrowth business and home life that is exactly how our pillars are organized by type. So the top level dashboard is organized bypillars that shows you how important the pillar 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=271)~~  status is and that the organization by pillar. Type is the fundamental organization to thedoorway or the on-ramp to the whole system, so beyond the type everything underneath itin this pillar to pipeline pyramid is in service of one of these pillars. These are structural elements to your life. They keep things together, they keep cohesionin your life, keep you on track that you can do what matters, projects are all linked tothis database habits and routines are linked to this database and that's one of the pillarsupports we're gonna get to in just a moment. Now, you could now just like in previous video,I showed you how you could have work spaces for goals and for projects you could havea workspace for each of these pillars. I don't tend to do that, I have the work spacesat the goal level, the project level and the action item level. But you could do it if you wanted somethingbroadly across your learning. I actually have broad themes in another Volvodatabase that I'll show you in a future video, so I don't really use these work spaces. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=327)~~  In terms of the pages inside these databaseitems, but I have them set up at the database, so everything under them can be linked througha database relation and notion and that alignment is clear and explicit and you can click throughany level of this pyramid structure. And it's important because add a habit oras I add a project I have to ask myself, Which pillar is that? Serving it's essential that it's serving atleast one of them. If not that I'm missing a pillar or that thingand shouldn't be added as a project or task so it forces me to ask the right questionsabout whether this is the task project, a goal that should be in my life. I have been getting question since doing thealignment zone video by people asking How do determine what your pillars are? Well, that's actually pretty easy. It's easier than some of the others, is easierthan the goals for example because these are largely the things already happening in yourlife, you need to break your life down into segments to have logical groupings. And the things I have here are pretty broadlyapplicable to a lot of people. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=387)~~  The business one, in particular, might havemore variety than others, but just about everybody would have a family pillar some type of homepillar, personal admin. I don't think you can avoid that. That's just a factor of life. You've got a lot of just administration ona personal level. Learning should be a pillar for absolutelyeverybody. Health and fitness, should be a pillar foreveryone, and then in terms of business, some of them will be there for everybody. Sales and marketing business admin, theseare things if you're running your own business if you work for a larger company and you havea more specific role in that company, you might have a narrower range you might havefewer. So just look at what you're doing day-to-day,and break them out into 12 or 10 categories grouped by growth, personal growth, businessand home life and work them out. You don't want too many. You could go up to 15 or... So you don't have to few you want them tomean something and have distinctions for some people's spiritual pursuits might be one forsome people hobbies, might be one gardening, 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=442)~~  if you're really passionate about something,gardening might be on a specific hobby depending on how big of a role it plays and whetherit's worth having as a pillar and having multiple value goals and goal outcomes and projectsunderneath it. So, if something, if you are really into gardeningor you're really into Dungeons and Dragons, you're really into something that's prettyspecific. That could be a pillar on its own. Otherwise, hobbies are crafts, or artisticpursuits could all be... Each of those are examples of what could bea pillar. Just depends on what's happening in your lifeand then think about who you wanna become. Do you want to leave your job and start abusiness? You want to start a new activity that maybeyou wanna get into cycling in a big way. Maybe cycling becomes one rather than healthand fitness, if you're just obsessive about that one thing. But generally, Health and Fitness is a goodone. You, you might break health and fitness outinto physical activity and nutrition separately for me, having them together in the same one. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=496)~~  So Health and Fitness is a combination ofphysical fitness, nutrition, and mental clarity to meditation, and the kinds of habits, routines,I do to develop clarity of thought. So that is basically pillars. It's really not that complicated, it's justthese ongoing aspects of your life that need to be addressed and maintained in a perpetualway. These things are not gonna stop at the endof a quarter or a year, or many years. Some of them could end at some point, butthey tend to go on for years rather than quarters or even a single year and some of them willnever and some of them are literally day one to the end of your life, that's totally fine. Now, we also have an area for pillar supportthings that are not feeding into the goals so much not feeding into the projects, butare maintaining and enhancing these areas of importance like learning and health andfitness and product development, and client execution and family. So those things first and foremost would behabits, routines, these are ongoing as well. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=552)~~  I created a database here. Not so much because I have a lot of them,but because it organizes them in a nice way. And of course, the pillars are connected throughrelational connections, between those two databases. So this is important because you're beingvery explicit, deliberate and intentional about defining what habits and routines youwant in your life to shape yourself and become the person you want to be. So I have things like I wanna wake up by 0A-M. at the latest aim for 5-30. AM to be honest, I have been off track forthat lately, but the fact that it's written out as a habit, and routine, I want to achieveI am going to, through my weekly reviews recognize that that is off-track and I'm gonna bringthat back into alignment, because it is a deliberately articulated Part of my explicithabits and routines in order to do that, I need to be in bed by 10 PM at the latest aimfor 930. so, your evening routine and your morningroutine, or part of your routine? And they need to be explicit but planner andjournal data tracking which we did a whole 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=609)~~  video on the data tracking, if you wanna seewhat that's all about that is fundamental to to moving towards your pillars, that'sabout tracking progress that comes out of your habits routines. So meditating nutrition and diet reading hourto reading doesn't go into my task database unless there's a hard design. I have to complete a book by for some veryspecific reason, but for the most part, I've got a list of books in priority in my book,vault, which is another data base in notion that I'll share in a future video, but I havedesignated in this database, I say what the frequency is, in the case of reading, hoursdaily in the time of day late afternoon or evening, it is supporting the learning pillarand it's connected to one of my vault, which is all about aggregating information acrossthe specific topic from different sources and it's connected in some of these cases,it's feeding into a goal outcome. So reading is supporting my goal outcome toread and summarize 20 leading books in my field. So, I've got this database structured likethis. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=664)~~  Again, I'm not using these as work spaces,so there's not a lot of information inside of them, it's just what you see here. But this lets me lay out my day and I laymy calendar I follow the protocol established in the habits and routines table right here,then I've got mindset. We're going to do a whole another video onmindset, an identity sculpting this is fundamental to becoming the person you need to becometo achieve the goals that you have in life. You are not a fixed entity you are, constantlyevolving and constantly changing and if you take deliberate action to shape yourself inthe direction you wanna go, you're gonna get there faster and you have a much higher probabilityof getting there at all, 'cause if you just let nature push you and pull you in differentdirections, who knows where you could end up. I like to take deliberate action, to becomethe kind of person and shape the identity of who I wanna become, to create the kindof outlook and framework on life that is gonna be most helpful to achieving the things thatmatter to me. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=720)~~  So we're going to do a whole video on thatmindset is a section of pillar support, and then health and fitness. The table in here just tracks my workouts. We'll do a whole video on this in the future,and I don't have one. But if you found nutrition to be somethingyou're struggling with, I would have a database on nutrition, I get one of those nutritionapps, track the calories or whatever metric you're using to evaluate your nutrition andthen enter that data in either your daily tracking or your health. And fitness a lot of the pillars support happensin the daily tracking, database, which we did a whole video on previously. So look back on the daily tracking, videothat is essential to pursuing your pillars and executing on your pillars as well, asyour value goals. Fact my daily tracking database, it's sucha fundamental part of Pillar support that that should be here at... So even if you go into my pillars, pipelinesand voles organizational structure here which I know I've been getting questions about thatwe're going to do a whole video after we go 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=770)~~  through each of the individual pillars pipelinesinvolved, we will then do a video on how the organizational structure works together, butsuffice it to say at this point, they're in folders by pillars pipelines involved withan aggregating dashboards folder that pulls from the pillars pipelines and volts organizationalstructure in the Pillars folder is daily tracking that's just copy the link, we will add a dailytracking right there, we will highlight it, we will add the link. So even if I'm not going to access it fromhere, it's nice to have it here because it reminds me, it's part of the structure, havingthe visual cues that tell you that these are the pillar supports even if you're accessingthat from a different dashboard. In my case, I access it from the actions ondashboard which we also did a video on if you're interested. But when I pop is open and I go into habits,I'll see yeah okay, so mindset health and fitness, and daily tracking or all in supportof my pillars. It just helps that intentionality in thatdeliberate alignment. 
 - ~~[â–¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YPlLuIPORc&t=213s&t=830)~~  So that's pretty much it. Pillars are not complicated but they're reallyessential to the whole alignment structure of the system. You have any thoughts or questions on pillarsor pillar supports to leave them in the comments below? If you didn't catch the last few videos ongoals and projects or the whole alignment zone, there are videos on each of those thatgo into more detail, especially the alignment zone that shows how this whole dashboard isinterconnected.
