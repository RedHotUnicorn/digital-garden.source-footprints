Welcome!
```

I’m Jacky. This is my little [hypertext](./thoughts/hypertext) [garden](./posts/networked-thought) on the [Internet](./thoughts/Internet) — make yourself at home!
Currently, I’m exploring what [agentic](./thoughts/agency) and [communal](./posts/agentic-computing) technology looks like at [Replit](https://replit.com/) and through my [independent research practice](./tags/rhizome). How might we create infrastructures and technologies that empower the residents of the web to have access to the same tools as the architect?
On a broader level, I care deeply about creating *spaces* that enable others to have more [agency](./thoughts/agency): agency to ask questions without judgement; agency to do what they are intrinsically drawn toward; agency to [play](./thoughts/play) (because what’s the point if we can’t have a bit of fun?).
As far as ‘about’ pages go, most try to reduce the vast complexity of a person into a couple of sentences. Here, I hope it acts as an open invitation into the many winding paths throughout this garden.
Here are some places you may want to visit:
[The oak letter desk](./posts/): a collection of my favourite[writing](./thoughts/writing);[The hand-crafted workbench](./thoughts/Projects): a selection of projects I’ve worked on;[The crumpled pages in the recycling bin](./posts/a-failure-resume): my failure resume;[The bookshelf on the far wall](./books): books that are in some state of read, being read, or to be read.
```
Enjoy your time here and let me know if you need anything! jacky :)
