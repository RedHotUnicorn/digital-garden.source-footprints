Welcome!
```

I’m Jacky. This is my little [hypertext](./thoughts/hypertext) [garden](./posts/networked-thought) on the [Internet](./thoughts/Internet) — make yourself at home!


Currently, I’m exploring what [agentic](./thoughts/agency) and [communal](./posts/agentic-computing) technology looks like at [Replit](https://replit.com/) and through my [independent research practice](./tags/rhizome). How might we create infrastructures and technologies that empower the residents of the web to have access to the same tools as the architects?


On a broader level, I care deeply about creating *[spaces](https://lu.ma/playspace)* that enable others to have more [agency](./thoughts/agency): agency to ask questions without judgement; agency to do what they are intrinsically drawn toward; agency to [play](./thoughts/play) (because what’s the point if we can’t have a bit of fun?).


As far as ‘about’ pages go, I hope this acts as an open invitation into the many winding paths throughout this garden. Here are some places you may want to visit:
