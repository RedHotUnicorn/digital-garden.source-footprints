=================================================================

Works with any programming language or visualization grammar [Star](https://github.com/microsoft/lida)Systems that support users in the automatic creation of visualizations must address several subtasks - understand the semantics of data, enumerate relevant visualization goals and generate visualization specifications. In this work, we pose visualization generation as a multi-stage generation problem  and argue that well-orchestrated pipelines based on large language models (LLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) are suitable to addressing these tasks. We present LIDA, a novel tool for generating grammar-agnostic visualizations and infographics. LIDA comprises of 4 modules - A SUMMARIZER that converts data into a rich but compact natural language summary, a GOAL EXPLORER that enumerates visualization goals given the data, a VISGENERATOR that generates, refines, executes and filters visualization code and an INFOGRAPHER module that yields data-faithful stylized graphics using IGMs. LIDA provides a python api, and a hybrid user interface (direct manipulation and multilingual natural language) for interactive chart, infographics and data story generation.

Click on the video below for an overview of the capabilities of the LIDA user interface.![](/lida/images/videoscreen.png)Watch Video LIDA leverages the language modeling and code writing capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in enabling core automated visualization capabilities (data summarization, goal exploration, visualization generation, infographics generation) as well as operations on existing visualizations (visualization explanation, self-evaluation, automatic repair, recommendation).  AutoViz Core automated visualization capabilities Data SummarizationDatasets can be massive. LIDA summarizes data into a compact but information dense natural language representation used as grounding context for all subsequent operations.Automated Data ExplorationUnfamiliar with a dataset? LIDA provides a fully automated mode that generates meaningful visualization goals based on the dataset. EDA for free.Grammar-Agnostic VisualizationsWant visualizations created in python in Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc? How about R, C++ ? LIDA is grammar agnostic i.e., can generate visualizations in any grammar represented as code.Infographics GenerationConvert data into rich, embellished, engaging stylized infographics using image generation models. Think data stories, personalization (brand, style, marketing etc.)?  VizOps Operations on Generated Visualizations Visualization Explanation  Get detailed descriptions of visualization code. This has applications in accessibility, data literacy, education, and debugging/sensemaking of visualizations. Self-EvaluationLLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 encode visualization best practices. LIDA applies these capabilities in generating multi-dimensional evaluation scores for visualizations represented as code.Visualization RepairLIDA provides methods to automatically improve visualizations (via self-evaluation feedback) or repair visualizations based on user provided or compile feedback.Visualization RecommendationsGiven some context (goals, or an existing visualization), LIDA can recommend additional visualizations that may be useful to the user (e.g., for comparison, or to provide additional perspectives).[Learn more in the paper â†’](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.11/)System ArchitectureSystem architecture for LIDA![](/lida/files/lidamodules.jpg) Architecture for LIDALLM = Large Language Model | IGM = Image Generation Model ![](/lida/files/infographics_small.jpg) Example infographics generated with LIDA FAQ What are known limitations?LIDA may not work well for visualization grammars that are not well represented in the LLM's training dataset. Similarly, we will likely see improved performance on datasets that resemble example datasets available online. Performance is bottlenecked by the choice of visualization libraries used and degrees of freedom accorded the model in generating visualizations (e.g., a strict scaffold constrained to only visualization generation vs a generation scaffold with access to multiple libraries and general code writing capabilities). LIDA currently requires code execution. While effort is made to constrain the scope of generated code (via scaffolding), a sandbox environment is recommended to ensure safe code execution.[Learn more in the paper â†’](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.11/)How is this built?
