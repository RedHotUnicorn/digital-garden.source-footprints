flake8-simplify
===============


A [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) plugin that helps you simplify your code.


Installation
------------


Install with `pip`:



```
pip install flake8-simplify
```

Python 3.8 to 3.11 are supported.


Usage
-----


Just call `flake8 .` in your package or `flake your.py`:



```
$ flake8 .
./foo/__init__.py:690:12: SIM101 Multiple isinstance-calls which can be merged into a single call for variable 'other'

```

Rules
-----


Python-specific rules:


* `SIM101`: Multiple isinstance-calls which can be merged into a single call by
using a tuple as a second argument ([example](#SIM101))
* [`SIM104`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/4) [![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4bc45a69d3ffcbd91fc11087ff7315f9bb72cffc4ba946a386b8c54ebb6d81a4/68747470733a2f2f736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d6c65676163796669782d696e616374697665)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4bc45a69d3ffcbd91fc11087ff7315f9bb72cffc4ba946a386b8c54ebb6d81a4/68747470733a2f2f736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d6c65676163796669782d696e616374697665): Use 'yield from iterable' (introduced in Python 3.3, see [PEP 380](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-380)) ([example](#SIM104))
* [`SIM105`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/5): Use ['contextlib.suppress(...)'](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress) instead of try-except-pass ([example](#SIM105))
* [`SIM107`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/9): Don't use `return` in try/except and finally ([example](#SIM107))
* [`SIM108`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/12): Use the ternary operator if it's reasonable ([example](#SIM108))
* [`SIM109`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/11): Use a tuple to compare a value against multiple values ([example](#SIM109))
* [`SIM110`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/15): Use [any(...)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any) ([example](#SIM110))
* [`SIM111`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/15): Use [all(...)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all) ([example](#SIM111))
* [`SIM113`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/18): Use enumerate instead of manually incrementing a counter ([example](#SIM113))
* [`SIM114`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/10): Combine conditions via a logical or to prevent duplicating code ([example](#SIM114))
* [`SIM115`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/17): Use context handler for opening files ([example](#SIM115))
* [`SIM116`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/31): Use a dictionary instead of many if/else equality checks ([example](#SIM116))
* [`SIM117`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/35): Merge with-statements that use the same scope ([example](#SIM117))
* `SIM119`: [![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dbe5dfaa0b175e6fccb4e85cfe4ed26c395fe2ec9dc02d5c64c2668563ac2969/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d72656d6f7665642d6c6967687467726579)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dbe5dfaa0b175e6fccb4e85cfe4ed26c395fe2ec9dc02d5c64c2668563ac2969/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d72656d6f7665642d6c6967687467726579) Moved to [flake8-scream](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-scream) due to [issue 63](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/63)

Simplifying Comparisons:

* `SIM124`: Reserved for SIM909 once it's stable


**Experimental rules:**


Getting rules right for every possible case is hard. I don't want to disturb
peoples workflows. For this reason, flake8-simplify introduces new rules with
the `SIM9` prefix. Every new rule will start with SIM9 and stay there for at
least 6 months. In this time people can give feedback. Once the rule is stable,
the code will change to another number.


Current experimental rules:


* `SIM901`: Use comparisons directly instead of wrapping them in a `bool(...)` call ([example](#SIM901))
* `SIM904`: Assign values to dictionary directly at initialization ([example](#SIM904))
* [`SIM905`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/86): Split string directly if only constants are used ([example](#SIM905))
* [`SIM906`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/101): Merge nested os.path.join calls ([example](#SIM906))
* [`SIM907`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/64): Use Optional[Type] instead of Union[Type, None] ([example](#SIM907))
* [`SIM908`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/50): Use dict.get(key) ([example](#SIM908))
* [`SIM909`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/114): Avoid reflexive assignments ([example](#SIM909))
* [`SIM910`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/171): Avoid to use `dict.get(key, None)` ([example](#SIM910))
* [`SIM911`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/161): Avoid using `zip(dict.keys(), dict.values())` ([example](#SIM911))


Disabling Rules
---------------


You might have good reasons to
[ignore some flake8 rules](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/3.1.1/user/ignoring-errors.html).
To do that, use the standard Flake8 configuration. For example, within the `setup.cfg` file:



```
[flake8]
ignore = SIM106, SIM113, SIM119, SIM9
```

Examples
--------


### SIM101



```
# Bad
isinstance(a, int) or isinstance(a, float)

# Good
isinstance(a, (int, float))
```

### SIM102



```
# Bad
if a:
    if b:
        c

# Good
if a and b:
    c
```

### SIM105



```
# Bad
try:
    foo()
except ValueError:
    pass

# Good
from contextlib import suppress

with suppress(ValueError):
    foo()
```

Please note that `contextlib.suppress` is roughly 3x slower than `try/except`
([source](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/91)).


### SIM107



```
# Bad: This example returns 3!
def foo():
    try:
        1 / 0
        return "1"
    except:
        return "2"
    finally:
        return "3"


# Good
def foo():
    return_value = None
    try:
        1 / 0
        return_value = "1"
    except:
        return_value = "2"
    finally:
        return_value = "3"  # you might also want to check if "except" happened
    return return_value
```

### SIM108



```
# Bad
if a:
    b = c
else:
    b = d

# Good
b = c if a else d
```

### SIM109



```
# Bad
if a == b or a == c:
    d

# Good
if a in (b, c):
    d
```

### SIM110



```
# Bad
for x in iterable:
    if check(x):
        return True
return False

# Good
return any(check(x) for x in iterable)
```

### SIM111



```
# Bad
for x in iterable:
    if check(x):
        return False
return True

# Good
return all(not check(x) for x in iterable)
```

### SIM112



```
# Bad
os.environ["foo"]
os.environ.get("bar")

# Good
os.environ["FOO"]
os.environ.get("BAR")
```

### SIM113


Using [`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) in simple cases like the loops below is a tiny bit easier to read as the reader does not have to figure out where / when the loop variable is incremented (or if it is incremented in multiple places).



```
# Bad
idx = 0
for el in iterable:
    ...
    idx += 1

# Good
for idx, el in enumerate(iterable):
    ...
```

### SIM114



```
# Bad
if a:
    b
elif c:
    b

# Good
if a or c:
    b
```

### SIM115



```
# Bad
f = open(...)
...  # (do something with f)
f.close()

# Good
with open(...) as f:
    ...  # (do something with f)
```

### SIM116



```
# Bad
if a == "foo":
    return "bar"
elif a == "bar":
    return "baz"
elif a == "boo":
    return "ooh"
else:
    return 42

# Good
mapping = {"foo": "bar", "bar": "baz", "boo": "ooh"}
return mapping.get(a, 42)
```

### SIM117



```
# Bad
with A() as a:
    with B() as b:
        print("hello")

# Good
with A() as a, B() as b:
    print("hello")
```

Thank you for pointing this one out, [Aaron Gokaslan](https://github.com/Skylion007)!


### SIM118



```
# Bad
key in a_dict.keys()

# Good
key in a_dict
```

Thank you for pointing this one out, [Aaron Gokaslan](https://github.com/Skylion007)!


### SIM120



```
# Bad
class FooBar(object):
    ...


# Good
class FooBar:
    ...
```

Both notations are equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter.


### SIM201



```
# Bad
not a == b

# Good
a != b
```

### SIM202



```
# Bad
not a != b

# Good
a == b
```

### SIM203



```
# Bad
not a in b

# Good
a not in b
```

### SIM208



```
# Bad
not (not a)

# Good
a
```

### SIM210



```
# Bad
True if a else False

# Good
bool(a)
```

### SIM211



```
# Bad
False if a else True

# Good
not a
```

### SIM212



```
