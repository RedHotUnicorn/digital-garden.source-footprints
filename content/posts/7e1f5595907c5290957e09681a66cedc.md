I'm going on the assumption that you "have a set of URLs" that you need to pre-filter prior to doing something else with. Based on this assumption you could use *urlparse* and some string patterns to filter out X percentage of the URLs in your set that are *most likely* non-articles.



```
import re as regex
from urllib.parse import urlparse

urls =['https://candid.org/privacy-policy',
       'https://happify.com/health/privacy-policy',
       'https://www.abstract.com/legal/customer-terms-of-service',
       'https://pesa.org.au/membership/terms-of-service-and-privacy-statement',
       'https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html',
       'https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-rss-feeds',
       'https://www.sciencedaily.com/newsfeeds.htm',
       'https://www.ndtv.com/rss']

patterns = ['privacy-policy', 'customer-terms-of-service', 'terms-of-service-and-privacy-statement', 'rss-feeds',
            'newsfeeds', 'rss']
for url in urls:
    split_url = urlparse(url)
    possible_article = [pattern for pattern in patterns if regex.findall(pattern, split_url.path)]
    if not possible_article:
        print(f'Possible article: {url}')
        # output 
        Possible article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html

```

You could potentially expand the regular expression above to flag other URLs that meet common article URLs that can date strings or common keywords, such news or wirestory.



```
import re as regex
from urllib.parse import urlparse

urls =['https://www.ndtv.com/rss',
       'https://candid.org/privacy-policy',
       'https://www.sciencedaily.com/newsfeeds.htm',
       'https://happify.com/health/privacy-policy',
       'https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-rss-feeds',
       'https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55675826',
       'https://www.abstract.com/legal/customer-terms-of-service',
       'https://pesa.org.au/membership/terms-of-service-and-privacy-statement',
       'https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html',
       'https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-galaxy-s21-upgrades-likely-wont-spell-an-end-to-galaxy-fe-or-note-lines-yet',
       'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-leave-washington-morning-bidens-inauguration-75278801?cid=clicksource_4380645_6_heads_hero_live_headlines_hed']

non_article_patterns = ['privacy-policy', 'customer-terms-of-service', 'terms-of-service-and-privacy-statement',
                        'rss-feeds', 'newsfeeds', 'rss']

known_article_patterns = ['\d{4}\/\d{2}\/\d{2}', 'news', 'wireStory']

for url in urls:
    split_url = urlparse(url)
    non_article = [pattern for pattern in non_article_patterns if regex.findall(pattern, split_url.path)]
    if non_article:
        pass
    else:
        possible_article = [pattern for pattern in known_article_patterns if regex.findall(pattern, split_url.path)]
        if possible_article:
            print(f'Possible article: {url}')
            Possible article: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55675826
            Possible article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html
            Possible article: https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-galaxy-s21-upgrades-likely-wont-spell-an-end-to-galaxy-fe-or-note-lines-yet
            Possible article: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-leave-washington-morning-bidens-inauguration-75278801?cid=clicksource_4380645_6_heads_hero_live_headlines_hed

```

**BUT** as *Erwan* pointing out in his comment it's not clear "how you define the difference between *article* and *not article*", so my answer is only part of a potential solution to your problem of URL classification.


It's hard to make any solid recommendation for any "out-of-the-box" solution that can meet an undefined use case.


Here are some links that might help you:


I'm still of the mindset that your use case will likely require a multi-prong approach and will need to be refined as more URLs are classified as either "an article or non-article."
