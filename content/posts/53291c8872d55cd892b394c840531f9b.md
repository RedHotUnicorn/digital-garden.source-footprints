Projects is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that lets you manage and visualize notes for project management.


* Create projects from folders and Dataview queries.
* Switch between four different views: *Table*, *Board*, *Calendar*, and *Gallery*.
* Configure note templates for each project.


For example, if you're a content manager, Projects can help you manage your content calendar. Create drafts, keep track of their status, and when they are scheduled to be published.

Installation
------------


Note

You must turn off **Restricted mode** to use Projects.


1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**.
2. Under **Community plugins**, select **Browse**.
3. Search for "Projects" by Marcus Olsson, and then select it.
4. Select **Install**.


To get started using Projects, press **Ctrl+P** (or **Cmd+P** on macOS) to open the **Command palette**, and then select **Projects: Show projects**.


Design Philosophy
-----------------


When developing any software, you are often faced with difficult choices. To help guide design decisions, this project adheres to the following principles:


* **Leave no trace:** The plugin must not leave any plugin-specific configuration in the notes, such as custom front matter properties. Notes may be shared with colleagues and teams who don't use Obsidian. If the user stops using this plugin, they shouldn't have to clean up all their notes.
* **Keep it native:** The plugin should look and feel like it's native to Obsidian. The plugin should also prefer native Web APIs over custom components whenever possible.
* **Stability over features:** This plugin is geared towards professionals with high demands on reliability. Any bug reports and usability issues will be prioritized over new features.
