Face detection
--------------



 We will no longer use face detection to determine the suitable crop frame for the picture. This means that users have to adjust the crop frame on the uploaded picture manually.
 


General security information
----------------------------



 The website can be accessed via HTTPS connection. This ensures that your pictures are encrypted during the uploading and downloading procedures. However, avoid public Wi-Fi connection when using the website.

With the help of this website you can create a passport photo based on the standards of several countries with ease and you don’t need to use a complicated and expensive photo editing software.
