Hey, I'm Jeff, the founder of Athens Research.  
  
I started Athens after interviewing at Roam Research in March of 2020.  
  
I loved Roam. I thought it could be the most powerful technology for knowledge management ever created.  
  
But some technologies are so powerful that they must be democratized to all.  
  
Not just free, but open â€” open incentives, open development processes, and open-source code.  
  
I believe networked platforms like Athens will transform the way we use the internet and computers.  
  
And I believe they should be [open](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/).
