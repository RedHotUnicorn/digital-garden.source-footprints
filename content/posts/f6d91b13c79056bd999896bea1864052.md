Path Styles Example
[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/edge-path-styles.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/edge-path-styles.png)

Custom Colors
-------------


Add custom colors to the color picker. You can add them using the following css snippet:



```
:root {
    /* Where X is the index of the color in the palette */
    /* The colors 1-6 are already used by Obsidian */
    --canvas-color-X: 0, 255, 0; /* RGB */
}
```


Custom Colors In Palette
[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/custom-colors.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/custom-colors.png)

Properties Support
------------------


Support for properties in canvas files just like in md files. You can edit the properties using the updated control menu.


Supported properties:


* `cssclasses`


### Custom Background Example (cssclasses)



```
.canvas-wrapper.<CLASS-NAME> > .canvas-background {
    background-image: url('<IMAGE-URL>');
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    
    filter: blur(5px) brightness(0.8);
}
```

Stickers
--------


Convert image nodes to stickers. Stickers have a transparent background and no border.



Sticker Example
[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/stickers.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/stickers.png)

Presentation Mode
-----------------


In presentation mode, you can navigate through the nodes using the arrow keys. The different slides/nodes are connected using arrows. If you want to have multiple arrows pointing from the same node, you can number them in the order you want to navigate through them. While in presentation mode, the canvas is in readonly mode (So [better readonly](#better-readonly) effects the presentation mode as well!). You can exit the presentation mode using the `ESC` key.

### More Complex Example

Canvas File
[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/sample-presentation-complex.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/sample-presentation-complex.png)

### Usage


* Create the first slide
	+ Create the first slide of the presentation using the updated popup menu
	+ OR create a node and mark it as the first slide using the updated card menu
* Add more slides
	+ Link the slides using arrows
		- If you want to loop back to a previous slide, you can number the arrows in the order you want to navigate through them
	+ **TIP:** Create slides with consistent dimensions by using the updated card menu
* Control the presentation
	+ Start the presentation using the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Start presentation`)
	+ Change slides using the arrow keys
	+ Exit the presentation using the `ESC` key


Portals
-------


Embed other canvases inside your canvas and create edges (arrows) to the embedded canvas.


[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/sample-portal-usage.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/sample-portal-usage.png)


### Usage


* Embed a canvas file and click on the door icon of the popup menu to open a portal


Collapsible Groups
------------------


Collapse and expand groups to organize your canvas.



Collapsible Groups Example
[![](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/raw/main/assets/collapsible-groups.png)](/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/blob/main/assets/collapsible-groups.png)

Better Readonly
---------------


* Disable node popup menus
* Lock the canvas' position
* Lock the canvas' zoom
* BUT to retain some interactivity, it allows zooming to a bounding box (e.g. zoom to selection, zoom to fit all)


### Usage


* Use the updated control menu to toggle the new features (Only shown if the canvas is in readonly mode)


Encapsulate Selection
---------------------


Move the current selection to a new canvas and create a link in the current canvas.


### Usage


* Select the nodes you want to encapsulate
* Use the context menu (right click) to encapsulate the selection
* OR use the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Encapsulate selection`)
