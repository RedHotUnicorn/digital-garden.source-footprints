**Learn how to take Smart Notes in** [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) to *boost* your productivity and *improve* your ability to think.

Collecting is rewarding. It feels productive to ingest information and unproductive to spend time digesting it. But a body that doesn't digest is malnourished and a mind that doesn't process its input is starved.  


By taking smart notes you slow down your rate of consumption, reduce information overload, and ensure you extract the nutrients of wisdom from the information you consume.  


Includes: free *90-minute video course.*
