About these notes
=================

Hi! I’m [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org). You’ve stumbled upon my working notes. They’re kind of strange, so some context might help.

These notes are mostly written for myself: they’re roughly my thinking environment ([Evergreen notes](/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX); [My morning writing practice](/zHTevHGZQPu8QHpRhUmtsuK)). But I’m sharing them publicly as an experiment ([Work with the garage door up](/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ)). If a note seems confusing or under-explained, it’s probably because I didn’t write it for you! Sorry—that’s sort of an essential tension of this experiment ([Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience](/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9)).

For now, there’s no index or navigational aids: you’ll need to follow a link to some starting point. You might be interested in [§What’s top of mind](/zPKTSiU725W9WQCqoVPBcxm).

PS: My work is made possible by a crowd-funded research grant from my Patreon community. You can [become a member](http://patreon.com/quantumcountry) to support future work, and to read patron-only updates and previews of upcoming projects.

PS: Many people ask, so I’ll just note here: no, I haven’t made this system available for others to use. It’s still an early research environment, and [Premature scaling can stunt system iteration](/zKKB5ENRahwftH96H7mijiu).
