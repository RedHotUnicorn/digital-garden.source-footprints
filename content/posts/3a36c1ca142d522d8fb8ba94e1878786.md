Creating smooth, organic-looking shapes can be difficult, especially when you need many different ones. Blobmaker makes it easy to create unique blob shapes based on random data.

Modify the complexity (number of points) and contrast (difference between points) to create different types of organic svg shapes. Press that dice button until you find a blob you like and download it as an SVG or copy the code directly to your clipboard.
