Iâ€™m going to gather some queries here that will be useful for task management.



It wonâ€™t be done in one go and I will be adding inline comments to help you understand what is going on. I have added those to build on the queries in order. So read through them all as I have only added comments the first time a statement appeared.


Hopefully this will help you be able to edit the queries for yourself.

Tasks scheduled value is past due (based on today)



```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "ðŸ”¥ Past scheduled"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
   :in $ ?day  ; ?day is the name for the first value in inputs further down.
   :where
     [?b :block/marker "TODO"]  ; Using TODO straight in the clause because I want marker to be a specific value.
     [?b :block/scheduled ?d]  ; the block ?b has attribute scheduled with value ?d
     [(< ?d ?day)]  ; the value ?d is smaller than the value ?day
 ]
 :inputs [:today]  ; use the Logseq dynamic variable :today as input for this query (gives today's date as yyyymmdd format)
 :table-view? false
}
#+END_QUERY

```


```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "âœ… Planned"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
 :where
   [?b :block/marker ?marker]
   [(contains? #{"TODO" "LATER"} ?marker)]  ; TODO put in a value list with LATER.
   [?b :block/scheduled ?d]  ; ?b has attribute scheduled with value ?d, ?d is not further specified and so is any value. The same can be accomplish with _
 ]
 :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (fn [r] (get-in r [:block/scheduled])) result)) ; sort the result by the scheduled date
 :table-view? false
 :breadcrumb-show? false  ; don't show the parent blocks in the result !important, due to result-transform the grouping is lost, and so you will be left with a simple list of TODO items. having those parents blocks mixed in may make the list more confusing. (setting this to true won't show the page btw!)
 :collapsed? false
}
#+END_QUERY

```


```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "â˜‘ Unplanned"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
 :in $ ?day
 :where
   [?p :block/journal-day ?d]  ; ?p has the attribute journal-day with value ?d (you don't need the :block/journal? attribute if you also use this one)
   [(< ?d ?day)]
   [?b :block/page ?p]  ; ?b has the attribute :block/page with value ?p, ?p has been define with the identifier of a journal page above.
   [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
   (not [?b :block/scheduled _])  ; ?b doesn't have the attribute scheduled (_ is used to say that the value doesn't matter. If a value is specified it would read as ?b may have the attribute, but not with that value)
 ]
 :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (fn [r] (get-in r [:block/page :block/journal-day])) result))  ; Sort by the journal date
 :inputs [:today]
 :table-view? false
 :breadcrumb-show? false
 :collapsed? false
}
#+END_QUERY

```

Tasks open from yesterdayâ€™s journal page, that donâ€™t have a deadline/scheduled date or their deadline/scheduled date was yesterday.



```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "ðŸ”¥ Yesterday's open tasks"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
 :in $ ?day
 :where
   [?p :block/journal-day ?day]  ; Here we input the value of the input into the clause immediately as it is an = statement.
   [?b :block/page ?p]
   [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
   (or
     [?b :block/scheduled ?day]  ; Either the scheduled value is equal to ?day
     (not [?b :block/scheduled])  ; or the scheduled attribute doesn't exist (_ is omitted here, it is instead implied)
   )
   (or
     [?b :block/deadline ?day]  ; same as above, but for the deadline attribute.
     (not [?b :block/deadline])
    )
 ]
 :inputs [:yesterday]
 :table-view? false
}
#+END_QUERY

```

Not yet scheduled with deadline on certain day (I use the coming Sunday as a date)



```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "ðŸŽ¯ Not yet planned"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
 :in $ ?day
 :where
   [?b :block/deadline ?d]
   [(<= ?d ?day)]
   [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
   (not [?b :block/scheduled _])
]
  :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (fn [r] (get-in r [:block/deadline])) result))
  :breadcrumb-show? false
  :table-view? false
  :inputs [20230212]
}
#+END_QUERY

```

Planned, with deadline on certain date (again I use the next Sunday)



```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "ðŸŽ¯ Planned"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
 :in $ ?day
 :where
   [?b :block/deadline ?d]
   [(<= ?d ?day)]
   [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
   [?b :block/scheduled _]
 ]
 :result-transform (fn [result] (sort-by (juxt (fn [r] (get-in r [:block/scheduled])) (fn [r] (get-in r [:block/deadline])) ) result))  ; Sort first by scheduled and then by deadline.
 :breadcrumb-show? false
 :table-view? false
 :inputs [20230212]
}
#+END_QUERY

```

```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "Tasks with page reference" ]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
    :where
      [?p :block/name "page"] ; name is always lowercase
      [?b :block/refs ?p] ; this block references ?p as oppose to being on ?p through :block/page.
      [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
 ]
}
#+END_QUERY

```


```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "Tasks without page reference" ]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
   :where
     [?p :block/name "page"] ; name is always lowercase
     [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
     (not [?b :block/refs ?p]) ; we cannot use not until we have specified the variables used in it
 ]
}
#+END_QUERY

```

Tasks that are not scheduled and not on a page with `tags:: projecten` (this property creates page links)



```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:h3 "ðŸ”” Ongeplande taken"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
   :where
     [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
     (not [?b :block/scheduled])
     [?b :block/page ?p]
     [?pr :block/name "projecten"]
     (not [?p :block/tags ?pr])
 ]
 :table-view? false
}
#+END_QUERY

```

This uses a more complex `or` statement. This is basically a logical or. it is needed here as variable `?a` is only for use in the `or`. `[?b ?p]` means these two variables are bound with the rest of the query.

```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title ["Query by page & alias"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
   :in $ ?page
   :where
     [?b :block/marker "TODO"]
     [?p :block/name ?page]
     (or-join [?b ?p]
       [?b :block/refs ?p] 
       (and [?p :block/alias ?a] ; this attribute is available only when alias:: has been specified as a page property.
          [?b :block/refs ?a])
     )
 ]
 :result-transform :sort-by-priority
 :table-view? false
 :inputs [:current-page] ; alternatively use :query-page to use the page the query is on, rather than the page you are viewing
}
#+END_QUERY

```
