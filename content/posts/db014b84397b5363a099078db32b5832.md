What if it were fast to build
-----------------------------

and actually looks good?
------------------------

No code

Notion-like UI

Build multi-page CRUD dashboards without writing any SQL or JavaScript. Just type '/' to add text, connect tables, and insert your custom plugins.

Not just tables

Filters. Sorts. Hidden columns. Adjustable column widths. Click into a row and get a detailed view. Automagically.

Security

Granular access for data sources

Set read/write access on your data sources, down to column-level controls. Then use them safely in your dashboards.

Bring your own code

Develop custom plugin blocks using your favorite IDE and frameworks to power up your dashboard. If it runs on the web, you can plug it into your dashboard.
