Features Overview
-----------------


* Native app (written in C++ with Qt).
* Turn your Markdown tasks into a beautiful Kanban board.
* Fast and beautiful.
* Fully open source and cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
* Completely private - tracks nothing.
* Folders and tags. Organize your ideas hierarchically using nested folders and universally using tags.
* Markdown Support. Format text without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
* Different themes. Switch between Light, Dark, and Sepia.
* Feed View. Select multiple notes to see them all one after another in the editor.
* Always runs in the background. Use the hotkey `Win`+`Shift`+`N` to summon Notes. `Ctrl`+`N` for macOS.
* Keyboard shortcuts. Meant to have the option to be used solely with a keyboard (but more work needs to be done on that).
* What feature will you contribute?


Keyboard shortcuts
------------------


All keyboard shortcuts are [documented here](/nuttyartist/notes/blob/master/docs/keyboard_shortcuts.md).

You can also donate money either through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nuttyartist), or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rubymamis), or put a bounty on specific issues using Bountysource. If you wish, you can access all Pro features at no cost by building the app from source. See "Building from source" below.
