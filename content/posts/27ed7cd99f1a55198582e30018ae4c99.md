 Sandboxing at Scale
 


Meet Fly Machines
-----------------



 Full Linux micro-VMs running on our metal, built from your own containers with a single command or API call.
 


[Learn More](/docs/machines/)
* Launch Instantly
 

 Fly Machines boot in around 300ms, fast enough to start in response to HTTP requests.
* Clone Globally
 

 Use machines as templates to place your app in any region we serve.
* Scale to Zero
 

 Pause machines when they’re not in use, paying only for machines that actually run.
* Zero-Config Secure Networking
 

 Machines automatically connect to our global Anycast network and to IPv6 private networks.



 Cubicle and Jira account not included
 


Enterprise-Ready
----------------



 Apps running on Fly Machines are KVM hardware-isolated, built on a memory-safe stack and running directly on our metal.
 


[Enterprise Features](/enterprise)
[Fly.io Security](/security)
* Single Sign-On
* Guaranteed Support Response Times
* SOC2 Type 2 Attested
* Memory-safe Rust and Go stack
* CI/CD Integration



 No Poster Board Necessary
 


Globally Distributed Databases Without the Science Project
----------------------------------------------------------



 Fly Anycast HTTP lets apps control routing, enabling single-writer multi-reader clusters for super-fast reads.
 


* Fast nVME Storage
-----------------



 Create Fly Volumes from 1 to 500 gigabytes with a single command; they show up as directories in your VMs, use them however you like.
* Automated Backups
-----------------



 Fly Volumes are snapshotted to off-network durable encrypted storage, no extra config required.
* Postgres Cluster Management
---------------------------



 Automatic leader election, fail-over, and member management, built on standard Postgres tooling.
