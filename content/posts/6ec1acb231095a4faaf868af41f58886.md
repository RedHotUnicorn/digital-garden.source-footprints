    iCloud Drive/
    ├─ Scriptable/
    │  ├─ LSWeather.js
```

1. Launch Scriptable and make sure that `LSWeather` is listed in the Scripts view.

		+ Add *some* wallpapers to this Album.
		+ Shortcut will automatically pick up a wallpaper at random from this album.

		+ Shortcut will automatically pick up a wallpaper at random from this folder.
4. Download and install this [shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8282/).
5. Configure the shortcut as mentioned below.
6. Run the shortcut.


### Shortcut Configuration - LSWeather


1. Open the shortcut in Shortcuts app.
2. Set the dictionary key value `layout` to one of the predefined values `'welcome'`, `'minimalWeather'`, `'feelMotivated'`, `'minimalCalendar'`, `'showMyWork'` and `'maximalWeather'`.
3. Set the dictionary key value `apiKey` to your openWeather API key.
	* Note: if `layout` and `apiKey` are not passed from Shortcuts app, it should be defined in the LSWeather script.
4. You can use either Photos Album or iCloud Folder to pick wallpapers for this script. To change that, look for the dictionary with `Photos` and `iCloud` boolean values and set either of them to `true`. Default is Photos.


### Script Configuration - LSWeather


1. OpenWeather API


	* Open the script in the Scriptable editor and add your openweather API key at `const WEATHER_API_KEY=`
	* Get your own API key for free [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Account is needed.
	* Note: Value passed from Shortcuts app will over-ride the API key value set in the script.
2. Template


	* Set `LAYOUT` to one of the predefined values `'welcome'`, `'minimalWeather'`, `'feelMotivated'`, `'minimalCalendar'`, `'showMyWork'` and `'maximalWeather'`.
	* Or use your customer layout by setting `LAYOUT = 'custom'`.
	* Note: Value passed from Shortcuts app will over-ride values set in the script.
3. Configure Weather Details


	* To show/hide weather details set `WEATHER_SHOW_WEATHER` to `true` or `false`. Hiding weather details will not call the openweather API.
	* To change weather units set `WEATHER_UNITS`. Default is `metric`.
	* To change locale/language set `WEATHER_LANG`. Default is `en`.
	* You can get valid values of `WEATHER_UNITS` & `WEATHER_LANG` [here](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).
4. Configure Calendar Details


	* To show/hide calendar details set `CALENDAR_SHOW_CALENDARS` to `true` or `false`.
	* To show/hide all day events set `CALENDAR_SHOW_ALL_DAY_EVENTS` to `true` or `false`.
	* To show/hide tomorrow events set `CALENDAR_SHOW_TOMORROW_EVENTS` to `true` or `false`.
	* Set-up personal calendars to be displayed with `CALENDAR_PERSONAL_CALENDARS`.
		+ Ex. `const CALENDAR_PERSONAL_CALENDARS = ['Gmail','Football'];`.
		+ If this variable is empty (`[]`), script will automatically fetch the default calendar for iOS.
	* Set-up work calendars to be displayed with `CALENDAR_WORK_CALENDARS`.
		+ Ex. `const CALENDAR_WORK_CALENDARS = ['Work'];`.
		+ If this variable is empty (`[]`), script will not display anything. In this case also set `hide` value to 1 for the layout item `workText` (See details below).
	* Maximum personal events to show set `CALENDAR_PERSONAL_MAX_EVENTS`.
	* Maximum work events to show set `CALENDAR_WORK_MAX_EVENTS`.
	* Set-up colors for different calendars with variable `CALENDAR_COLORS`.
	* To turn on/off calendar colors set `CALENDAR_SHOW_COLORS` to `true` or `false`.
5. Configure Quote Details


	* To show/hide quotes set `QUOTE_SHOW_QUOTES` to `true` or `false`. Hiding quotes details will not call the API.
	* Change quote tags with `QUOTE_TAGS` to get quotes for specific categories.
		+ Ex. `const QUOTE\_TAGS=['wisdom','friendship'].
		+ Leave blank to get random quote across all categories.
		+ You can get list of all valid tags [here](https://api.quotable.io/tags).
	* To change maximum length of quotes to be fetched set `QUOTE_MAX_LENGTH`.
	* To change quotes wrap length set `QUOTE_WRAP_LENGTH`.
6. Configure Update Notification


	* Whenever an update is available on GitHub, a red update notification will appear on the top right corner.
	* You can configure the number of days the script should look for an update by setting `UPDATE_CHECK_DAYS`.
	* Set above value to 0 to stop looking for updates (not recommended).
7. To show/hide last wallpaper updated time set `SHOW_LAST_UPDATED_TIME` to `true` or `false`.
8. To test the script without calling the openweather & quotable APIs set `TESTING` to `true`.
9. To change the layout of the data elements update dictionary `layouts`. Checking items which you can change easily to play around with the layout.
10. Logging


	* To generate logs in the iCloud drive when script is run through shortcut set `LOG_TO_FILE` to `true`. Only set this to true to debug an issue.
	* Check script logs in **LSWeatherLogs** folder in iCloud/Scriptable (logs are only saved to file when the script is run from Shortcuts, else logs are displayed on the console).
