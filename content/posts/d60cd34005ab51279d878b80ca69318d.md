Getting things done (GTD) is one
of **the most popular personal productivity systems out there.** Developed
by David Allen, the first version of the book of the same title was published in
2001, and after 20 years, we can safely say the system has survived the test of
time. 


The tagline for the framework is
“the art of stress-free productivity” and it offers a set of tools, techniques,
and productivity recommendations. 

Using the GTD system should **help you to be
more relaxed at work, accomplish more, be more creative, and keep track of everything
crucial,** namely all the relevant things in your work and personal life. 


In summary, the main idea of the GTD
system is to record everything relevant (tasks, interests, projects, other relevant
information) in one’s mind by capturing it on paper or digitally, and then
breaking the items down into actionable work items, always knowing what the
next step is. 


The only potential downside of the
Getting Things Done system is that it can get a little bit complicated. The
lack of daily/weekly structure (such as that provided in [SCRUM](scrum-guide "Link: https://www.spica.com/blog/scrum-guide")) and recommendations
for [prioritizing
tasks](the-eisenhower-matrix "Link: https://www.spica.com/blog/the-eisenhower-matrix") might also be a weakness. 


Nevertheless, in this article
we’ll cover the most important GTD ideas, so you can **quickly test the system
and see if it works for you**; and even if it doesn’t work for you as a whole,
you will definitely find many inherent parts of the system to be valuable
productivity tips.


**What you will find out in this article**

The Getting Things Done workflow
--------------------------------


**The Getting
Things Done workflow consists of five steps** which help you to break bigger
tasks into smaller manageable steps. and then to immediately do those small
steps that lead you to the desired outcome. 

The five steps on which the Getting
things done workflow is based on are:


1. Capture
2. Process
3. Organize
4. Review
/ Reflect
5. Engage

Let’s take a closer look at each
of the GTD steps in the workflow:


Step 1: Capture
---------------

Capturing everything outside
one’s mind is crucial, since **our brains are much better at processing, than
storing data.** 

Building a system to keep everything outside one’s mind (frequently
called “the second brain”) frees capacity and makes us more productive at
intellectual, creative, or analytical tasks. 

Also, having all important
information kept in one place can help you choose priorities and focus on the
most important tasks much easier.


So as the first step in GTS, you should
capture everything that comes to your mind; every idea, task, or anything else
that is worth remembering (things to read and watch, notes, bills, etc.). Capture
everything in the inbox to unload your mind. 

**Only an unloaded mind can think
clearly and produce elite outputs.** On top of that, the main strength of
your mind is for creating ideas, not holding and remembering them.


It’s important that y**ou don’t
process items when capturing them, even if you’re tempted to do so;** but
even more so, the important thing is also to empty the inbox regularly. Things
shouldn’t just pile up, but should be regularly processed instead.

Step 2: Process
---------------

For each captured item comes the
most crucial question, which is: “What should the next action for an item be?” 

That’s the basis of the Getting Things Done philosophy - capturing everything that
you need to accomplish, being disciplined enough to make decisions about what
to do with each item, and finally executing each task flawlessly.


So, after you
capture all the items relevant to specific moment, the second step is to **analyze
them and decide what specifically to do with each item.** When processing,
you should first categorize each item into actionable or non/actionable items:


If an item is **non-actionable** (such as a document,
reference etc.…), you have to decide whether to: 


* Delete it
* Archive it
* Delay it

If the item is **actionable**, you have to
decide whether to: 


* Do it
* Delegate it
* Defer it

While doing
that, consider the following:


* If an item takes less than 2 minutes, you should
do it immediately.
* If it makes sense for the item, delegate it.
* If an item will be done in the near future,
assign a due date. Each time-sensitive item should have a due date.
* Provide context and reference items for each
item, such as documents, files, contacts, etc.

When processing items, **it’s
important to be as specific and actionable as possible.** 

Being specific and
actionable provides clarity on what exactly needs to be accomplished, and
motivates us to perform the next step; but before engaging in tasks, there are
two more steps to take:


Step 3: Organize
----------------

After
processing, organizing items comes into play. Organizing is about putting items
where they belong and providing everything needed for them to be engaged with.
When organizing, you should do four main things:


1. Put
an item in **four of the main action lists** (projects, next action, waiting
for, calendar).
2. **File
tasks under different labels.**
3. **Provide
items with context** - context is everything you need to be able to carry out
an action and it can be a place, a tool or a person.
4. Non-actionable
items that provide value should be **stored in a digital or paper-based
archive.** As mentioned, non-actionable items can be put in the trash (deleted),
stored as a reference (archived) or put in incubation, meaning it might be
needed later (delayed).

The main [productivity tools](best-time-management-tools "Link: https://www.spica.com/blog/best-time-management-tools")
to help you organize everything according to the GTD system are a filing
system, note taking app, calendar, and a trash can.

Step 4: Review and reflect
--------------------------

The goal of reflecting is to make
sure everything is up-to-date. **There’s no point of having a superior
productivity system if it’s not up-to-date and regularly “groomed”.** 

When
reviewing, you should update your lists, remove irrelevant items, add or remove
references, etc. 


You should do  your reviewing at least once per week.


Step 5: Engage
--------------

The final
step after capturing and identifying actionable items and properly filing and
reviewing them is to start working on the selected tasks. Before engaging in
any tasks, you should make sure that:


* You have **the right context** for the tasks.
As mentioned, context is what you need to be able to carry out an action,
* you have **enough time**,
* you have **enough energy**,
* and that the tasks have **the highest priority**.

Based on the
five-step workflow, each processed item in the “in” list (inbox) can end up in
one of the eight endpoints:


ACTION LISTS


1. **Do
immediately** – for each task that takes under two minutes
2. **The
Next action list** – the main task list, where each item is provided with
context
3. **Project
planning** – an item that needs to be broken down into actionable steps and
the outcome defined. In the Getting Things Done system, projects are any item
that requires more than two steps to complete.
4. **Calendar**
– all the items that you have to do on a certain date or at a certain time are
put here.
5. **Delegation
list / Waiting for list** – when you delegate an item and you wat for someone
else to complete it

OTHER LISTS


1. **Maybe
someday list** – projects you might want to realize at some time in the
future
2. **Reference**
– everything you might need at some point in the future as a reference, such as
bookmarks, formal and official documents, notes, bills, etc.
3. **Trash**
– you should put each item that has no actionable or reference value in the
trash

It’s really important to remember
to select the items to engage with based on priority, available context, and
the time and energy you have at your disposal.

The five horizons of focus and the five phases of project planning
------------------------------------------------------------------


Besides having full control over
the workflow and priorities, **perspective is also one of the key elements of
the Getting Things Done philosophy.**

David Allen suggests a bottom-up
approach, since it can be difficult to focus on “the big picture” if you don’t
have control over the daily tasks that need to be done. By mastering lower
horizons of focus, you can then move up to the higher levels of planning.


**The horizons
of focus in Getting things done are:**


* Runway (ground): Current actions
* Horizon 1 (10.000 feet): Current projects
* Horizon 2 (20.000 feet): Areas of focus and responsibility
* Horizon 3 (30.000 feet): 1-to-2-year goals
* Horizon 4 (40.000 feet): 3-to-5 year visions
* Horizon 5 (50.000 feet): Life

To achieve
maximum productivity and superior planning of your work and personal life, you
have to consider all five horizons. 

In the same way, when you’re focused on
executing projects, you should consider that every project goes through five planning
phases:


**Defining purpose**

In every project you
should first ask yourself “why?” [Start with why](start-with-why "Link: https://www.spica.com/blog/start-with-why") is
a principle that helps to clarify focus, align resources, and emotionally
motivate yourself. It gives a strong purpose to a project, and without purpose
it’s hard to accomplish anything.


**Visioning outcome**

We bring our
attention to the things that match our vision. So, it’s really important to
have a picture of the desired final outcome in mind, before we begin with a
project. That provides a clear destination we want to move towards.


**Brainstorming**

No project has a linear
path to success. That means we must solve many challenges on the way, by using
our creativity. Brainstorming helps us with that, since we can identify the
best ideas for how to get from our current state to the desired outcome.
Brainstorming also helps us to be focused on the topic and train our creativity
muscles to find different and out-of-the-box solutions.


**Organizing**

When we know why we want to
do something, what exactly we want to achieve, and what the possible creative
ways to get there are, it’s important to organize all the data in a way to make
things actionable. Organizing consists of identifying the different pieces of the
project, sorting them out in categories, considering all the necessary details for
execution, and then setting priorities.


**Identifying the next actions**

Getting
things done is always about figuring out what the next step is. When planning a
project, it is crucial that you have a plan for the next action in every part
of the project, abolishing all potential bottle necks. There’s no point in
having the best plan ever if you don’t execute it and get the planned work
done.


In addition, Getting
Things Done recommends that you control your projects, tasks, and other
commitments in two ways:


* **Horizontally –** Horizontal alignment means
that you exercise control with as much coherence as possible among the
different projects and activities you are involved in.
* **Vertically –** Vertical alignment means
that you control your thinking and execution among individual projects or topics
in your life.

The best Getting Things Done productivity tips
----------------------------------------------


The main time-management
tips from the Getting Things Done philosophy worth remembering are:


1. Make sure you keep track of everything going all
in your life, and don’t keep it in your brain, capture everything in your
“second brain”, and remember, **the most important thing to deal with is the
one that’s on your mind the most.**


2. Don’t have open loops (any item that isn’t where
it should be) that are pulling away your attention, and don’t get overwhelmed
by not following your intended outcomes and setting priorities accordingly. The
world itself is never overwhelming or confusing, **only we can be overwhelmed
and confused based how we are engaged with the world.**


3. If you feel anxious or guilty, it is probably
not because you have too much on your plate, but because of breaking an
agreement with yourself (not following your desired outcomes in a focused way).
Many times, things wander in your mind because they are not as you want them to
be. The best cure for that is defining what your desired outcome is, what the optimal
next action step is, and then to just go on to execution.


4. **Have a short-term and long-term list of
visioned outcomes, driven by purpose.** For these outcomes make sure you
always have a list of the next actions that need to be done. When planning,
define clearly what “done” (outcome) means exactly and what “doing” (action) to
getting to done actually looks like.


5. **Keep your inbox, lists, and calendar
regularly updated.** Nothing great can be accomplished with outdated data in
the productivity system. Garbage in, garbage out.

Getting Things Done – the physical or digital version?
------------------------------------------------------


You can implement the GTD system
by using a digital or paper system. **Both are considered as equally good.**
If you decide to go for the digital system, there are several software solutions
that support the GTD time management system, such as nTask, FacileThings, Todoist,
Nirvana, Flow-E and others.


And if you decide to go for the
paper system, you can build it yourself using different office supplies
(notebooks, calendars, file sorters, post-it notes, etc.), or you can buy one
of the sets that is put together exactly for the Getting Things Done system. 


Either way, we hope the GTD system
will help you to become more productive and successful in life.
