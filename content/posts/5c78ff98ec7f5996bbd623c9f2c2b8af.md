Continuing the discussion from [Dataview - Exporting Table as CSV](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-exporting-table-as-csv/29243) and based on my answer to another post [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/export-dataview-as-csv/37719/2), I’ve come up with an imperfect way to save dataview tables as csv fies, if that’s something you’d find useful.


This code does the following:


1. Grab the data you want
2. Select the columns you want in the table
3. Export the table as a CSV file


*Note: `dataviewjs` must be appended for code block*



```
// ----- Gather data and specify table columns -----
// Grab all relevant notes/pages
let projects = dv.pages("#projects");
// Grab the columns you want using .map function
const projects_tbl = projects.map(p => [p.file.link,p.status,p.domain]);
// Map function traverses each row and joins elements with ",", then we join the array of strings with "\n"
let csvContent = "data:text/csv;charset=utf-8," + projects_tbl.map(e => e.join(",")).join("\n");

// ------ Create CSV file ------
// Create a hidden <a> DOM node and set its download attribute as follows, where "my_data.csv" will be the name of your csv file
var encodedUri = encodeURI(csvContent);
var link = document.createElement("a");
link.setAttribute("href", encodedUri);
link.setAttribute("download","my_data.csv");
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();

```

I would use this at your discretion, as it uses some functions I am unaware of, but suffice to say I’ve tested this and I got a table just as I wanted, as a csv file. Once this code has run, it will automatically bring up a window to save the file, and bear in mind that this will keep running if you have set dataview queries to re-evaluate in Live-Preview. So, I would run it as a script perhaps?


Would love some extra suggestions to improve upon this to make it:


* More succinct
* More flexible
* *Edit: header info would be nice too*



```
// ----- Gather data and specify table columns -----
// Grab all relevant notes/pages
let <name_of_pages> = dv.pages("<source>");
// Grab the columns you want using .map function
const <table_name> = <name_of_pages>.map(p => [p.<field1>,p.<field2>,p.<field3>]);
// Map function traverses each row and joins elements with ",", then we join the array of strings with "\n"
let csvContent = "data:text/csv;charset=utf-8," + <table_name>.map(e => e.join(",")).join("\n");

// ------ Create CSV file ------
// Create a hidden <a> DOM node and set its download attribute as follows, where "my_data.csv" will be the name of your csv file
var encodedUri = encodeURI(csvContent);
var link = document.createElement("a");
link.setAttribute("href", encodedUri);
link.setAttribute("download","<csv_file_name>.csv");
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();

```

Is this going to get any table on the page? How I can set it up? Or just put it in a Templater and run it?

Hi [@Archie](/u/archie).


The JavaScript in my example is not actually grabbing any table on the page in this instance



This part of the code is the source of the data:



![](https://forum.obsidian.md/user_avatar/forum.obsidian.md/epabarker/48/30216_2.png) epabarker:

> `let <name_of_pages> = dv.pages("<source>");`



This part of the code determines the fields/attributes from said pages that will populate the table




![](https://forum.obsidian.md/user_avatar/forum.obsidian.md/epabarker/48/30216_2.png) epabarker:

> ```
> const <table_name> = <name_of_pages>.map(p => [p.<field1>,p.<field2>,p.<field3>]);
> 
> ```



You could run this code alongside rendering it, if you simply added code to render the same table like so:



```
const headers = ["Field 1", "Field 2", "Field 3"]
const elements = dv.pages("<source>").map(p => [p.<field1>,p.<field2>,p.<field3>]);
dv.table(headers, elements);

```

I’ve tried to present the most bare-bones way to achieve this goal, but I suspect a good way to do it might be an actual button that runs the code using the buttons plugin.


Again, this could do with more work, but I imagine having:


* Templater plugin
* Dataview plugin
* Buttons plugin


And then:


* Having a button;**in the file that you want a csv for**, perhaps on a regular basis;that links to a template
* A templater template that simply runs the code I have written above

Thank you , I agree that Buttons and Templater is the way to go to run it regularly. But I don’t still get it. How it is going to identify tables if (i don’t know any identifiers or name for them in dv code. I just use normal basic dataview code blocks. Should I put the table columns by their name (after AS ) or the variable linked to it.

Ah okay, I’ll explain the two concepts in parallel, with the same references in both cases:



```
TABLE
    field2 AS "Field 2",
    field3  AS "Field 3"
FROM <source>

```


```
let source = dv.pages("<source>");
const table = source.map(p => [p.<field1>,p.<field2>,p.<field3>]);
let csvContent = "data:text/csv;charset=utf-8," + table.map(e => e.join(",")).join("\n");
var encodedUri = encodeURI(csvContent);
var link = document.createElement("a");
link.setAttribute("href", encodedUri);
link.setAttribute("download","my_data.csv");
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();

```

Both can have optional WHERE conditions.


Finally, to make it clear, the Dataview code block as you are familiar with starts with ```dataview, and the DataviewJS code block starts with ```dataviewjs

Oh I see, so you making a table and exporting it at the same time, which makes sense. Thanks for clarifying it for me, I have very little experience with dataviewjs so far

Thank you [@epabarker](/u/epabarker) for sharing the code.



I am super new to dataview/js, but I really want to get to a button to click before it download the dataview table into a csv file. I did some research and here’s what I come up with based on your approach and some snippet other shared (link below):


```
// ----- Gather data and specify table columns -----
// Grab all relevant notes/pages
let <name_of_pages> = dv.pages("#日总结");
// Grab the columns you want using .map function
const headers = ["field1", "field2", "field3"]
const elements = dv.pages("<source>").map(p => [p.<field1>,p.<field2>,p.<field3>])
// Map function traverses each row and joins elements with ",", then we join the array of strings with "\n"
let csvContent = "data:text/csv;charset=utf-8," + headers + "\n" + elements.map(e => e.join(",")).join("\n");

// create button to click to download the csv file
const buttonMaker = (action) => {
    const btn = this.container.createEl('button', {"text": "click to download!"});
    btn.addEventListener('click', async (evt) => {
        action.click()
    });
    return btn;
};

// ------ Create CSV file ------
// Create a hidden <a> DOM node and set its download attribute as follows, where "my_data.csv" will be the name of your csv file
var encodedUri = encodeURI(csvContent);
var link = document.createElement("a");
link.setAttribute("href", encodedUri);
link.setAttribute("download","my_data.csv");
document.body.appendChild(link);
buttonMaker(link)

```

Hey [@zmyrenee](/u/zmyrenee), I actually came across this new plugin that exports tables to CSV files with a button [here](https://github.com/metawops/obsidian-table-to-csv-export) by [@metawops](/u/metawops). I haven’t had time to look through the code but I wonder if it takes a similar approach! My understanding is it’s limited to the first table in a file, but also works with dataview tables. Many thanks [@metawops](/u/metawops) !

Thanks so much, [@epabarker](/u/epabarker), for the nice mention! ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/blush.png?v=12 ":blush:")



Being able to export not just the first table in a note is one of the top prio enhancements that’s on the list way up. ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:") Just haven’t found the time, yet. ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=12 ":man_shrugging:")


Any preferences on that? A button beneath each table? Or any other ideas?

On a personal level I’d love to automate data export, so from that point of view it would be great to reference tables by an ID to export with a command. Or even collaborate with the advanced tables plugin! But yeah, I’d say much in the same way one has a copy code button for code blocks, an export CSV button for tables would be amazing.

I see. Good point, the automation idea. I’ll keep that in mind as I love automation, too.



But … How would you “automate” Obsidian commands? Is there another plugin for that? Are you talking about “scripting” Obsidian (commands)? How so? (Oh, we’re getting off-topic here, I suppose! ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/see_no_evil.png?v=12 ":see_no_evil:"))

To be honest I don’t know if I am the best person to ask these questions to as I don’t know JS or how obsidian functions more generally. I’m an academic so I’m more interested in the data science side. Off topic, I think what I’m really after is a way to query the entirety of my notes as a database. As in daily notes are the time stamps, and then all of the annotations are variables for said timestamps.

Yeah, I’m doing that, too, already. And I put all this metadata into MS Power BI and visualise my vault and my writing behaviour that way. It’s fun! ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:") Being able to do this was the reason for writing my plugin, btw. ![](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:")


Don’t know if you’re on LinkedIn but I wrote a post there and [@Edmund](/u/edmund) posted a few screenshots from his Power BI visualisations of his vault.

i can now simply select the whole table, copy into gpt4 code interpreter and ask it to make into excel for me.
