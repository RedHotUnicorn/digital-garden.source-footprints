### What's New in Pubsidian Neo ?


* Thank you for your support and feedback, I have added many new features as well as fixed some known bugs from the previous version.
* Here's a comprehensive list of newly added features in this "Neo" version.
* [![](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/raw/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s3.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s3.png?raw=true)
* **Search 2.0**
* + You can now search tags with full-text support with new Search 2.0.
	+ However, in this demo, you can only search couple of tags like "primary element", "tools", etc. along with traditional file name search.
	+ Since, this example contains highly co-related data, I have decided to disable full-text search for this particular example.
* **Share Now**
* + Share Now help you to share your current note with others.
	+ To share your current note, just click the "Share Current Note" button from the sidebar.
	+ It will automatically copy the URL of your current note to your clipboard.
	+ Simply send the copied URL with someone to share the note
* [![](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/raw/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s5.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s5.png?raw=true)
* **Graph 2.0**
* + Previously in Graph 1.0, one can only view the correlation of the notes in it. To open them, one had to go the sidebar menu.
	+ Graph 2.0 has removed this drawback. Now you can simply click on the name of the node to open them in the Content section.
	+ Also, Graph 2.0 introduces new color scheme, for better visualization.
	+ You can now also view unlimited number of nodes in Graph 2.0
	+ [![](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/raw/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s1.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s1.png?raw=true)
* **CORE 2.0**
* + New Pubsidian CORE, namely *data2.json* gives you the flexibility to choose the notes to list in pubsidian.
	+ To refrain a note from listing in the main mwnu, simply set the **"list"** value of the corresponding note to **false** in the *data2.json*.
	+ [![](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/raw/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s7.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/blob/main/assets/img/Pubsidian%20NEO/s7.png?raw=true)
	+ You can now also add custom tag and descriptions in *data2.json*

Why this project?
-----------------


* For the last couple of months, I'm using OBSIDIAN.md, a fantastic note-taking app, for tracking my studies and boosting productivity and **I LOVE IT**. But, after using for a while, yesterday, when I was about to present couple of notes to my friend, I had faced some serious challenges, publishing my notes.
* Browsing into the forum, I've come to know about Obsidian-Publish and some other alternatives. While [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) costs **8$ per month and works flawlessly** (which is btw a lot for the students like me with zero incomeðŸ˜¢), I have faced a hard time understanding its free alternatives. Also, all free alternatives lack the most interesting feature of OBSIDIAN, a.k.a the **Graph View**.
* That's why after 20+ hours of code and 6 cups of coffee, here's [my version](https://yoursamlan.github.io/pubsidian) of the free Obsidian Publish with **Graph View**ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³...

Quick-start guide
-----------------


This project is currently under development. I've added a single-click-convertor for pubsidian notes. Now, you can generate a web version of your obsidian notes just with a single script. Video tutorial is coming soon.


Quickstart Guide
----------------


### Pubsidian Convert GUI v1.0


* STEP-1: CONVERSION:


	+ Download [`PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe`](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian/releases/download/Windows/PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe)
	+ Copy and Paste this application to the obsidian directory, [i.e where your notes (.md) are stored.]
	+ Simply double-click to RUN `PubsidianConverter1.0alpha.exe`
	+ You will see a window, something like this:
	+ [![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33586885/130856672-35454bcd-3386-4afb-8ba7-33cba5b96d1d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33586885/130856672-35454bcd-3386-4afb-8ba7-33cba5b96d1d.png)
	+ Enter your name (It will be reflected as `***'S NOTEBOOK` in your pubsidian website) and hit `Convert to Pubsidian`. Now, a pop up window will arrive. Select the `Attachment folder, i.e., where the images, used inside your obsidian notes are stored` from the pop-up window.
	+ After running successfully, you'll get an `OUTPUT` directory, containing three elements: `index.html`,`data.json` and `pages` directory.
* STEP-2: HOSTING:


	+ Drag and drop your `OUTPUT` directory in [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop)


Voila!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ your site is online.
