**SQLFluff** is an open source, dialect-flexible and configurable SQL
 linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also
 works with Jinja templating and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most
 linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.
 




---


### Lint 🧼



**SQLFluff** finds issues with your SQL code and reports them back
 to you (and your team) automatically so that your code reviews can be
 more about function and less about form.
 


### Fix 🛠️



**SQLFluff** saves time by fixing linting issues found in your code
 to save you time, and make it easy to have consistent and legible SQL.
 


### Parse 📜



**SQLFluff** parses your SQL to catch a range of syntax issues without
 needing access to the database, so you can catch mistakes earlier in your
 development process.
 


### Configure ⚙️



**SQLFluff** is configurable to work with a range of SQL dialects and
 style choices. It has opinionated defaults, so you can get going easily,
 but a range of flexible configuration options to fit your local style.
