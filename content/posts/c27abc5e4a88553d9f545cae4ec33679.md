About
-----


Tableau Research is an industrial research team focused on Tableau’s mission of helping people see and understand data. We actively work to be a source of new and inspiring product and technology directions, generating ideas that influence, drive, or significantly change what Tableau delivers to customers. We are also active members of the academic community, where we regularly publish and participate in top-tier conferences and journals.
 


Team Charter
------------


Tableau Research’s charter is to explore ways in which a computer can support humans when they are exploring, interacting, or presenting data. Be it new ML models that can provide reasonable defaults, support data augmentation, better search algorithms for helping people discover content and answer their questions, tools for better supporting data presentations, or figuring out how new channels can support new experiences for seeing and understanding data.
