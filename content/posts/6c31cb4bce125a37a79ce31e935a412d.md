Improved Random Note Obsidian Plugin
====================================


Improved interaction with the knowledge base in so-called wandering mode by opening Random Notes


Unlike its analogs combines the following options:


* Opening a random note without having to create an intermediate search term
* Opening a random note in a new panel
* Excluding notes from specific folders from the output. Useful for excluding Archives, Templates and other service folders.
* Can open notes only with a certain tag and in combination with exclusion of certain folders from output.


The plugin is developed specifically for the Second Brain project ([https://second-brain.ru/](https://second-brain.ru/)).
