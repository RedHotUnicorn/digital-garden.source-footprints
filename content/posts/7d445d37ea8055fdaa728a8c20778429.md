Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [already using Quartz](./showcase) to publish personal notes, websites, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.


ðŸª´ Get Started
-------------


Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.


Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:



```
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once youâ€™ve done so, see how to:


1. [Writing content](./authoring-content) in Quartz
2. [Configure](./configuration) Quartzâ€™s behaviour
3. Change Quartzâ€™s [layout](./layout)
4. [Build and preview](./build) Quartz
5. Sync your changes with [GitHub](./setting-up-your-GitHub-repository)
6. [Host](./hosting) Quartz online
