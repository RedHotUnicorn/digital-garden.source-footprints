What is Retentioneering for?
Understand why customers leave your product and reduce churn rate
Increase conversion rate and engagement as well as LTV, ARPU, NPS and ROI
Explore how customers use your app or website
Not to pay for attracting those customers who buy nothing
Visualize the analytics results to see business growth points
Control of contractors with independent metrics
Market leaders are those who first to implement innovations 
and gain an edge over competitors. The analysis based on individual user trajectories replaces the classic funnel concept. This innovative analytics approach helps to identify where you`re missing out on user engagement opportunities, predict customer behavior and reduce churn rate by 30%.

How it works? 
6 steps of product optimization
![](/wp-content/themes/rete-website-wordpress-theme/img/block5_pic_1_en.svg)
1. Building 
individual trajectoriesUser trajectory is a sequence of user-generated events with their corresponding time points which identifies user’s behavior in an application. Users often use your product differently than managers, marketers and testers expects. Retentioneering automatically analyzes and identifies all product use cases.

2. Map of all user behavior 
types in the productEach user trajectory is transformed into a point in the event space (TF-IDF transformation). Then with the help of the TSNE algorithm this multidimensional space is projected onto easy to understand plane. After this for each user segment we derive key metrics, which help to understand user characteristics such as the segment size and conversion rate, CAC, LTV, Retention and other metrics.

3. Search for problems in the 
product through trajectoriesHaving detailed information about user actions and knowing how to turn them into trajectories, it is possible to find problems in the product by comparing problematic and successful users. We can identify the points at which unsuccessful users have difficulties and immediately correct them by analyzing the behavior of successful users at the same point.

4. Search for problematic 
and successful clustersIn one graph, we display users in the context that is important for the client and their product. For example, we can group users according to their behavior similarity and then distinguish users from different channels or highlight converted users. This approach helps to identify the segments of the most successful users and understand what exactly unites them.

5. Analysis of advertising 
channels through trajectoriesThe fact that users from different advertising channels show different LTV seems to be logical and natural. User trajectories can answer the question of why these differences occur and how you can make adjustments to the users’ behavior from certain channel in order to improve the efficiency of interaction with each of user.

6. Personalization 
and Predictive UIThe probability of a user’s conversion or the likelihood of a churn occurring varies at each time points. For example, an insufficiently motivated user can leave forever if they are faced with a complex interface. Knowing these probabilities and knowing how to calculate them "on the fly", you can change the user experience in real time to increase the likelihood of converting.
