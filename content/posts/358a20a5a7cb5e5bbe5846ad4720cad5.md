An often-quoted adage goes: Doing business without marketing is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you're doing, but no one else does.
As someone with a background in product development and engineering, I've always cared more about the product than about letting people know that the product exists. But it's an uncomfortable truth that there's no point in having a better product if no one knows about it. More ventures have likely died from not reaching others than from having a lousy solution. This is also why great businesses are built by multi-disciplinary teams—it takes many complementary skills to make a great product succeed. I think the phrase "[Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_a_better_mousetrap,_and_the_world_will_beat_a_path_to_your_door)" is rarely true.
Along these lines, if you can think of others who'd find Sketchplanations helpful or who might like my book [Big Ideas Little Pictures](https://sketchplanations.com/big-ideas-little-pictures?utm_source=website&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=book-link&utm_id=big-ideas-book), please consider sending on a link or your favourite sketch. After all, business without marketing... ;o)
The quote is usually attributed with "advertising" instead of "marketing" to Steuart Henderson Britt, a marketing professor and psychologist at Northwestern University. But I couldn't find any verifiable source of the quote to him on the internet, and I prefer it with the more generally applicable marketing, so I went with that. If you know of a trustworthy source for the quote, please let me know!
