üá®üá≠üéñÔ∏èü¶ô Swiss Army Llama
======================


[![](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama/raw/main/image_files/swiss_army_llama_logo.webp)](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama/raw/main/image_files/swiss_army_llama_logo.webp)
Introduction
------------


The Swiss Army Llama is designed to facilitate and optimize the process of working with local LLMs by using FastAPI to expose convenient REST endpoints for various tasks, including obtaining text embeddings and completions using different LLMs via llama\_cpp, as well as automating the process of obtaining all the embeddings for most common document types, including PDFs (even ones that require OCR), Word files, etc; it even allows you to submit an audio file and automatically transcribes it with the Whisper model, cleans up the resulting text, and then computes the embeddings for it. To avoid wasting computation, these embeddings are cached in SQlite and retrieved if they have already been computed before. To speed up the process of loading multiple LLMs, optional RAM Disks can be used, and the process for creating and managing them is handled automatically for you. With a quick and easy setup process, you will immediately get access to a veritable "Swiss Army Knife" of LLM related tools, all accessible via a convenient Swagger UI and ready to be integrated into your own applications with minimal fuss or configuration required.


Some additional useful endpoints are provided, such as computing semantic similarity between submitted text strings. The service leverages a high-performance Rust-based library, `fast_vector_similarity`, to offer a range of similarity measures including `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_similarity`, and [`hoeffding_d`](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2021/05/03/examples-hoeffding-d.html). Additionally, semantic search across all your cached embeddings is supported using FAISS vector searching. You can either use the built in cosine similarity from FAISS, or supplement this with a second pass that computes the more sophisticated similarity measures for the most relevant subset of the stored vectors found using cosine similarity (see the advanced semantic search endpoint for this functionality).


As mentioned above, you can now submit not only plaintext and fully digital PDFs but also MS Word documents, images, and other file types supported by the textract library. The library can automatically apply OCR using Tesseract for scanned text. The returned embeddings for each sentence in a document can be organized in various formats like records, table, etc., using the Pandas to\_json() function. The results can be returned either as a ZIP file containing a JSON file or as a direct JSON response. You can now also submit audio files in MP3 or WAV formats. The library uses OpenAI's Whisper model, as optimized by the Faster Whisper Python library, to transcribe the audio into text. Optionally, this transcript can be treated like any other document, with each sentence's embeddings computed and stored. The results are returned as a URL to a downloadable ZIP file containing a JSON with the embedding vector data.


In addition to fixed-sized embedding vectors, we also expose functionality that allows you to get back token-level embeddings, where each token in the input stream is embedded with its context in the string as a full sized vector, thus producing a matrix that has a number of rows equal to the number of tokens in the input string. This includes far more nuanced information about the contents of the string at the expense of much greater compute and storage requirements. The other drawback is that, instead of having the same sized output for every string, regardless of length (which makes it very easy to compare unequal length strings using cosine similarity and other measures), the token-level embedding matrix obviously differs in dimensions for two different strings if the strings have different numbers of tokens. To deal with this, we introduce combined feature vectors, which compute the column-wise mean, min, max, and std. deviation of the token-level emeddding matrix, and concatenate these together in to a single huge matrix; this allows you to compare strings of different lengths while still capturing more nuance. The combined results, including the embedding matrix and associated combined feature vector, can similarly be returned as either a zip file or direct JSON response.


Finally, we add a new endpoint for generating multiple text completions for a given input prompt, with the ability to specify a grammar file that will enforce a particular form of response, such as JSON. There is also a useful new utility feature: a real-time application log viewer that can be accessed via a web browser, which allows for syntax highlighting and offers options for downloading the logs or copying them to the clipboard. This allows a user to watch the logs without having direct SSH access to the server.

*TLDR:* If you just want to try it very quickly on a fresh Ubuntu 22+ machine (warning, this will install docker using apt):



```
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
cd swiss_army_llama
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

To run it natively (not using Docker) in a Python venv (recommended!), you can use these commands:



```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev antiword unrtf poppler-utils pstotext tesseract-ocr flac ffmpeg lame libmad0 libsox-fmt-mp3 sox libjpeg-dev swig redis-server -y
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
cd swiss_army_llama
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 swiss_army_llama.py
```

Then open a browser to `<your_static_ip_address>:8089` if you're using a VPS to get to the FastAPI Swagger page at `http://localhost:8089`.


Or to `localhost:8089` if you're using your own machine-- but, really, you should never run untrusted code with sudo on your own machine! Just get a cheap VPS to experiment with for $30/month.

Features
--------


1. **Text Embedding Computation**: Utilizes pre-trained LLama2 and other LLMs via llama\_cpp and langchain to generate embeddings for any provided text, including token-level embeddings that capture more nuanced information about the content.
2. **Embedding Caching**: Efficiently stores and retrieves computed embeddings in SQLite, minimizing redundant computations. It supports caching both fixed-sized embedding vectors and token-level embeddings.
3. **Advanced Similarity Measurements and Retrieval**: Utilizes the author's own `fast_vector_similarity` library written in Rust to offer highly optimized advanced similarity measures such as `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_similarity`, and `hoeffding_d`. Semantic search across cached embeddings is also supported using FAISS vector searching.
4. **Two-Step Advanced Semantic Search**: The API first leverages FAISS and cosine similarity for rapid filtering, and then applies additional similarity measures like `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_similarity`, and `hoeffding_d` for a more nuanced comparison.
5. **File Processing for Documents**: The library now accepts a broader range of file types including plaintext, PDFs, MS Word documents, and images. It can also handle OCR automatically. Returned embeddings for each sentence are organized in various formats like records, table, etc., using Pandas to\_json() function.
6. **Advanced Text Preprocessing**: The library now employs a more advanced sentence splitter to segment text into meaningful sentences. It handles cases where periods are used in abbreviations, domain names, or numbers and also ensures complete sentences even when quotes are used. It also takes care of pagination issues commonly found in scanned documents, such as awkward newlines and hyphenated line breaks.
7. **Audio Transcription and Embedding**: Upload an audio file in MP3 or WAV format. The library uses OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription. Optionally, sentence embeddings can be computed for the transcript.
8. **Token-Level Embeddings and Combined Feature Vectors**: Provides token-level embeddings to capture the context of each token in the input string. Introduces combined feature vectors by computing the column-wise mean, min, max, and std. deviation of the token-level embedding matrix, allowing comparison of unequal length strings.
9. **RAM Disk Usage**: Optionally uses RAM Disk to store models for faster access and execution. Automatically handles the creation and management of RAM Disks.
10. **Robust Exception Handling**: Features comprehensive exception management to ensure system resilience.
11. **Interactive API Documentation**: Integrates with Swagger UI for an interactive and user-friendly experience, accommodating large result sets without crashing.
12. **Scalability and Concurrency**: Built on the FastAPI framework, handles concurrent requests and supports parallel inference with configurable concurrency levels.
13. **Flexible Configurations**: Offers configurable settings through environment variables and input parameters, including response formats like JSON or ZIP files.
14. **Comprehensive Logging**: Captures essential information with detailed logs, without overwhelming storage or readability.
15. **Support for Multiple Models and Measures**: Accommodates multiple embedding models and similarity measures, allowing flexibility and customization based on user needs.
16. **Ability to Generate Multiple Completions using Specified Grammar**: Get back structured LLM completions for a specified input prompt.
17. **Real-Time Log File Viewer in Browser**: Lets anyone with access to the API server conveniently watch the application logs to gain insight into the execution of their requests.
18. **Uses Redis for Request Locking**: Uses Redis to allow for multiple Uvicorn workers to run in parallel without conflicting with each other.

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------


### RAM Disk Configuration


To enable password-less sudo for RAM Disk setup and teardown, edit the `sudoers` file with `sudo visudo`. Add the following lines, replacing `username` with your actual username:



```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -t tmpfs -o size=*G tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount /mnt/ramdisk

```

The application provides functionalities to set up, clear, and manage RAM Disk. RAM Disk is used to store models in memory for faster access. It calculates the available RAM and sets up the RAM Disk accordingly. The functions `setup_ramdisk`, `copy_models_to_ramdisk`, and `clear_ramdisk` manage these tasks.


API Endpoints
-------------


The following endpoints are available:


* **GET `/get_list_of_available_model_names/`**: Retrieve Available Model Names. Retrieves the list of available model names for generating embeddings.

For detailed request and response schemas, please refer to the Swagger UI available at the root URL or the section at the end of this `README`.


Exception Handling
------------------


The application has robust exception handling to deal with various types of errors, including database errors and general exceptions. Custom exception handlers are defined for `SQLAlchemyError` and general `Exception`.


Logging
-------


Logging is configured at the INFO level to provide detailed logs for debugging and monitoring. The logger provides information about the state of the application, errors, and activities.


The logs are stored in a file named `swiss_army_llama.log`, and a log rotation mechanism is implemented to handle log file backups. The rotating file handler is configured with a maximum file size of 10 MB, and it keeps up to 5 backup files.


When a log file reaches its maximum size, it is moved to the `old_logs` directory, and a new log file is created. The log entries are also printed to the standard output stream.


Here are some details of the logging configuration:


* Log Level: INFO
* Log Format: `%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
* Max Log File Size: 10 MB
* Backup Count: 5
* Old Logs Directory: `old_logs`


Additionally, the log level for SQLAlchemy's engine is set to WARNING to suppress verbose database logs.


Database Structure
------------------


The application uses a SQLite database via SQLAlchemy ORM. Here are the data models used, which can be found in the `embeddings_data_models.py` file:


### TextEmbedding Table


* `id`: Primary Key
* `text`: Text for which the embedding was computed
* `text_hash`: Hash of the text, computed using SHA3-256
* `llm_model_name`: Model used to compute the embedding
* `embedding_json`: The computed embedding in JSON format
* `ip_address`: Client IP address
* `request_time`: Timestamp of the request

### Database Relationships


1. **TextEmbedding - DocumentEmbedding**:


	* `TextEmbedding` has a Foreign Key `document_file_hash` that references `DocumentEmbedding`'s `file_hash`.
	* This means multiple text embeddings can belong to a single document embedding, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
2. **DocumentEmbedding - Document**:


	* `DocumentEmbedding` has a Foreign Key `document_hash` that references `Document`'s `document_hash`.
	* This establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Document` and `DocumentEmbedding`.
3. **TokenLevelEmbedding - TokenLevelEmbeddingBundle**:


	* `TokenLevelEmbedding` has a Foreign Key `token_level_embedding_bundle_id` that references `TokenLevelEmbeddingBundle`'s `id`.
	* This is a one-to-many relationship, meaning multiple token-level embeddings can belong to a single token-level embedding bundle.
4. **TokenLevelEmbeddingBundle - TokenLevelEmbeddingBundleCombinedFeatureVector**:


	* `TokenLevelEmbeddingBundle` has a one-to-one relationship with `TokenLevelEmbeddingBundleCombinedFeatureVector` via `token_level_embedding_bundle_id`.
	* This means each token-level embedding bundle can have exactly one combined feature vector.
5. **AudioTranscript**:


	* This table doesn't seem to have a direct relationship with other tables based on the given code.
6. **Request/Response Models**:


	* These are not directly related to the database tables but are used for handling API requests and responses.


Performance Optimizations
-------------------------


This section highlights the major performance enhancements integrated into the provided code to ensure swift responses and optimal resource management.


### 1. **Asynchronous Programming**:


* **Benefit**: Handles multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing efficiency for I/O-bound operations like database transactions and network requests.
* **Implementation**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` library for asynchronous database operations.


### 2. **Database Optimizations**:


* **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Mode**: Enables concurrent reads and writes, optimizing for applications with frequent write demands.
* **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Manages locked databases by retrying operations with progressive waiting times.
* **Batch Writes**: Aggregates write operations for more efficient database interactions.
* **DB Write Queue**: Uses an asynchronous queue to serialize write operations, ensuring consistent and non-conflicting database writes.


### 3. **RAM Disk Utilization**:


* **Benefit**: Speeds up I/O-bound tasks by prioritizing operations in RAM over disk.
* **Implementation**: Detects and prioritizes a RAM disk (`/mnt/ramdisk`) if available, otherwise defaults to the standard file system.


### 4. **Model Caching**:


* **Benefit**: Reduces overhead by keeping loaded models in memory for subsequent requests.
* **Implementation**: Uses a global `model_cache` dictionary to store and retrieve models.


### 5. **Parallel Inference**:


* **Benefit**: Enhances processing speed for multiple data units, like document sentences.
* **Implementation**: Employs `asyncio.gather` for concurrent inferences, regulated by a semaphore (`MAX_CONCURRENT_PARALLEL_INFERENCE_TASKS`).


### 6. **Embedding Caching**:


* **Benefit**: Once embeddings are computed for a particular text, they are stored in the database, eliminating the need for re-computation during subsequent requests.
* **Implementation**: When a request is made to compute an embedding, the system first checks the database. If the embedding for the given text is found, it is returned immediately, ensuring faster response times.

### Dockerized Llama2 Embeddings API Service App


A bash script is included in this repo, `setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh`, that will automatically do everything for you, including installing docker with apt install.


To use it, first make the script executable and then run it like this:



```
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

If you prefer a manual setup, then read the following instructions:


#### Prerequisites


Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow these steps to install Docker on Ubuntu:



```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker --version
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You may need to log out and log back in or restart your system to apply the new group permissions, or use sudo in the following steps to build and run the container.


#### Setup and Running the Application


1. **Clone the Repository:**


Clone the Swiss Army Llama repository to your local machine:



```
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
cd swiss_army_llama
```
2. **Build the Docker Image:**


Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:



```
sudo docker build -t llama-embeddings .
```
3. **Run the Docker Container:**


Run the Docker container, mapping the container's port 8089 to the host's port 8089:



```
sudo docker run -p 8089:8089 llama-embeddings
```
4. **Accessing the Application:**


The FastAPI application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8089` or at the static IP address of your VPS instance if you're running on one (You can get a 10-core, 30gb RAM, 1tb SSD with a static IP running Ubuntu 22.04 at Contabo for around $30/month, which is the cheapest I've found so far).


You can interact then with the API using tools like `curl` or by accessing the FastAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8089/docs`.
5. **Viewing Logs:**


Logs from the application can be viewed directly in the terminal where you ran the `docker run` command.


#### Stopping and Managing the Container


* To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or find the container ID using `docker ps` and run `sudo docker stop <container_id>`.
* To remove the built image, use `sudo docker rmi llama-embeddings`.




---


Startup Procedures
------------------


During startup, the application performs the following tasks:


1. **Database Initialization**:
	* The application initializes the SQLite database, setting up tables and executing important PRAGMAs to optimize performance.
	* Some of the important SQLite PRAGMAs include setting the database to use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode, setting synchronous mode to NORMAL, increasing cache size to 1GB, setting the busy timeout to 2 seconds, and setting the WAL autocheckpoint to 100.
2. **Initialize Database Writer**:
	* A dedicated database writer (`DatabaseWriter`) is initialized with a dedicated asynchronous queue to handle the write operations.
	* A set of hashes is created which represents the operations that are currently being processed or have already been processed. This avoids any duplicate operations in the queue.
3. **RAM Disk Setup**:
	* If the `USE_RAMDISK` variable is enabled and the user has the required permissions, the application sets up a RAM Disk.
	* The application checks if there's already a RAM Disk set up at the specified path, if not, it calculates the optimal size for the RAM Disk and sets it up.
	* If the RAM Disk is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the RAM Disk feature is disabled and the application proceeds without it.
4. **Model Downloads**:
	* The application downloads the required models.
5. **Model Loading**:
	* Each downloaded model is loaded into memory. If any model file is not found, an error log is recorded.
6. **Build FAISS Indexes**:
	* The application creates FAISS indexes for efficient similarity search using the embeddings from the database.
	* Separate FAISS indexes are built for token-level embeddings.
	* Associated texts are stored by model name for further use.


Note:


* If the RAM Disk feature is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the application will disable the RAM Disk feature and proceed without it.
* For any database operations, if the database is locked, the application will attempt to retry the operation a few times with an exponential backoff and a jitter.
