 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=6)~~  Tom: Everybody welcome to Impact Theory. You are here because like me you believe thathuman potential is nearly limitless but you know that having potential is not the sameas actually doing something with it. Our goal with this show and company is tointroduce you to the people and ideas that are going to help you actually execute onyour dreams. All right, today’s guest is one of the mostpopular on air commentators and opinion writers for CNN and her unique brand of raw and relatableadvice has made her one of the most sought after speakers and media personalities. Watching her you get the feeling that thismother of three is just getting started. Her well researched and really powerful insightsinto what it means to be a human come wrapped in both science and lovely mid-western charm,allowing her to cut through the formality of typical business jargon and grab her audiencesby the emotions. She has made a name for herself by being;blunt, unapologetic and yet totally vulnerable. She says what everybody is already thinkingbut is just a little too scared to say and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=69)~~  it makes people absolutely love her. It is not hard to understand why her Ted Talktitled; how to stop screwing yourself over is one of the most watched Ted Talks of alltime. It’s also easy to see why she is an awardwinning talk radio host who is trusted by some of the biggest brands on the planet tohelp motivate and advice their teams. She has appeared on everything from Good MorningAmerica and The Today Show to Dr. Phil and Oprah. Somehow she has also made time to found aninspirational news site called inspire52.com and found and sell a retail and internet techcompany. Please help me in welcoming the former criminaldefense attorney who has been called an explosion of inspiration. The bestselling author with a brand new booktitled; The 5 Second Rule. The master of motivation herself; Mel Robbins. It’s really good to have you on the show. Mel: Oh my gosh thank you. Tom: Absolutely. Mel: You called me the master of motivationand I think motivation is complete garbage so maybe we should start there. Tom: That is a perfect place to start so Itotally agree with you but why do you say 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=138)~~  that? Mel: You do? Tom: I do 100%. Now I said that in the spirit of I know whatyou are trying to do so it is meant with absolute reverence, but why do you say that it’sgarbage? Mel: Well and we’ll talk a lot about thisbut I think it’s garbage because at some point we all bought into this lie that you’vegot to feel ready in order to change. We bought into this complete falsehood thatat some point you are going to have the courage, at some point you are going to have the confidenceand it’s total bullshit frankly. Are we allowed to swear on this show? Mel: Absolutely. Tom: Okay, it’s complete garbage so thereare so many people in the world and you may be watching this right now and you have theseincredible ideas and what you think is missing is motivation and that’s not true. Because the way that our minds are wired andthe fact about human beings is that we are not designed to do things that are uncomfortableor scary or difficult. Our brains are designed to protect us fromthose things, because our brains are trying 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=205)~~  to keep us alive. In order to change, in order to build a business,in order to be the best parent, the best spouse to do all those things that you know you wantto do with your life, with your work, with your dreams you are going to have to do thingsthat are; difficult, uncertain or scary. Which sets up this problem for all of us,you are never going to feel like it. Motivation is garbage, you only feel motivatedto do the things that are easy right? Tom: Why do you think that is? Mel: I know exactly why that is because I’vestudied this so much, because for me one of the hardest things to figure out was why isit so hard to do the little things that would improve my life. What I’ve come to realize and what we’lltalk a lot about today is that the way that our minds are designed is our minds are designedto stop you at all cost from doing anything that might hurt you. The way that this all happens is it all startswith something super subtle that none of us ever catch and that is with this habit thatall of us have that nobody is talking about. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=280)~~  We all have a habit of hesitating. We have an idea you are sitting in a meetingyou have this incredible idea and instead of just saying it you stop and you hesitate. Now what none of us realize is that when youhesitate just that moment that micro moment, that small hesitation it sends a stress signalto your brain. It wakes your brain up and your brain allof a sudden goes, “Wait a minute why is he hesitating he didn’t hesitate when heput on his killer spiky sneakers, he didn’t hesitate with the really cool track pants,he didn’t hesitate with a NASA t-shirt now he’s hesitating to talk something must beup.” Then your brain goes to work to protect you,it has a million different ways to protect you one of them is called the spotlight effect. It’s a known phenomenon where your brainmagnifies risk, why? To pull you away from something that it perceivesto be a problem. You can truly trace every single problem orcomplaint in your life to silence and hesitation, those are decisions. What I do and what’s changed my life iswaking up and realizing that motivation is 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=347)~~  garbage I’m never going to feel like doingthe things that are; tough or difficult or uncertain or scary or new so I need to stopwaiting until I feel like it. Number two, I am one decision away from; atotally different marriage, a totally different life, a totally different job, a totally differentincome, a totally different relationship with my kids. Not like one decision I’m divorcing youin a marriage example but one decision on, you could be having a conversation with yourspouse and you feel your emotions rise up and within a tiny window those emotions cantake over and can impact how your marriage goes. You can learn how to take control of thatmicro moment and make a decision to act in a way that actually shifts your marriage. Your life comes down to your decisions andif you change your decisions you will change everything. Tom: That core concept comes through so powerfullyin your book which is phenomenal and I would love it if you would take a second to tellpeople the story of how, and by the way I 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=416)~~  wore the NASA shirt because of the imagery. Mel: Oh is that why you wore it? Tom: Of course. Mel: Oh my God I’ve like falling my glassesoff that is, I did not even get that. I was going to ask you why you wore that shirtoh my gosh, wow. Tom: Break it down. Mel: You actually do your homework. Tom: Of course Mel absolutely. Mel: Let me just take you back, so what youare talking about is the five second rule which has become literally my life’s workand it was all a gigantic mistake. I read up on you too and understand how questlike was born out of misery. The five second rule and my life now and my20 year marriage and everything that I’m doing and the companies that I’ve builtand sold and the company I’m building now, it all comes back to a point in my life thatcompletely and utterly blew. I was 41 years old I was unemployed, my husbandhad started a restaurant business which was his dream this is actually a funny story. When he got laid off from a big job in hightech and I think he was really relieved, you 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=483)~~  know how a lot of us wait to quit our jobsand then we get laid off and are like, “Yes.” He said, “I’m not going to look for ajob I’m going to go into the restaurant business,” and I think I said the most famouslines of our marriage at that point. I looked at him and I said, “Listen buddyinspiration is for strangers you get your butt back to that job and you pay the mortgage.” Again micro moment where …Tom: That is amazing. Mel: ... I’m being a jerk instead of beinga supportive wife. That’s an example of where when he saidhe was not going to go get a job but he was going to start a business, the first thingthat was there was fear. Fear was making the decision for me. Tom: God I love that you could share thatthough, that’s so powerful. Mel: What happened is the first restaurantwas a home run and of course what do you do when things are successful? You grow it, you grow it really big. They decided to raise money and we threw inour home equity line, the kid’s college savings, they tried to open a second and athird and at the same point a grocery store 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=541)~~  chain. I encouraged them to go into wholesale, soit basically got way too big way too first and the wheel started to come off. They came off so badly that the second restaurantfailed and they held on to it for too long like a lot of us do. It’s another trick our brains play on uscalled [inaudible 00:09:18]. When you throw a ton of time and a ton ofmoney at something it’s really hard to let go of it and if you haven’t done it in business,we all had a relationship in our past stayed way too long that was a trick your brain playedon you. By the time that they closed the second restaurantit was an $800,000 loss. Tom: Whoa. Mel: I mean that meant our entire home equityline gone. It meant kid’s college, I just choked justthinking about how terrifying it was. I found myself at the age of 41 like justfeeling like a complete failure and so did Chris. To make it worse not only had we lost allof our savings, but so many friends and family members had invested so there was this realtension between the truth of what was happening 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=608)~~  and what you had to do in public because itwas public business; shame, failure, embarrassment and the lien started to hit the house. The phone started to ring and it was nothingbut collection calls. I just remember feeling this tremendous shameand at some point I think we all hit that moment in life where things just are not goinghow you thought they would go. What’s amazing about those moments is weall respond very differently. My husband he would spring out of bed andhe would head right out that door six o’clock in the morning and he would go meet his partnerand they would go to the bank and they would dig right in and they would face their problemshead on. He is also a smart guy I mean he did not wantto be in the house when yours truly woke up because I was a raging bitch at that pointin our lives. The reason why is because when you are scaredand you are afraid and you are jealous and you are overwhelmed with emotions, it is somuch easier to point the finger at other people. That’s a decision by the way one you maynot be aware that you are making but you are 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=675)~~  still making it. What would happen to me is the exact opposite,is Chris would be gone the alarm would go off at six o’clock in the morning and Iwould lie there. I would think about the lien on the houseand I would think about the bankruptcy that we were facing and I would think about howmuch we had fought the night before and I would think about the fact that I was unemployed. I would hit the snooze button I mean why wouldyou get up when your life is like that? Why would you? I needed confidence, I needed courage I wasso tapped out. In the scheme of life hitting the snooze buttonis not that big of a deal but here is the thing about life; none of us wake up and say,“Today is the day I destroy my life.” What we do is we kind of check out becauseit feels overwhelming or we check out because we’re afraid or we check out because westart listening to self-doubt and then we make these teeny-tiny decisions all day longand we don’t even realize it. Decision to not get up on time, a decisionto not eat the right thing, a decision to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=745)~~  snap at your kids, a decision to not speakat a meeting, a decision to not look for a job, a decision to not deal with your finances,a decision to not call your parents like whatever it is. All day long these tiny decisions that takeyou so far off track and then you wake up like I did and you look at your life and youthink, “How the hell did I get here,” and more importantly how do you get back overthere and you have no idea. I was to strapped and I know from your storyyou felt the same way, like you knew that there was more in store for you but you couldn’tfigure how do you close that gap. How do you find the power that’s in you,how do you discover your greatness, how do you solve these problems I feel so overwhelming. When you can … I mean I would go to thegrocery store and the items would scan and I would be sitting readying my excuse becausethere was no way that my check card was going to clear. Tom: Wow. Mel: I got in this struggle with myself thata lot of us find ourselves in and that is you get trapped in what I call the knowledge-actiongap. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=817)~~  You know what to do but you can’t seem tomake yourself do it. I mean every one of us is one Google searchaway from a list of instructions that if you follow any of them …Tom: That’s a really good point. Mel: ... it will change your life. How do you get out of your head and stop thinkingabout what you need to do and actually do it. In my case this stuff was pretty easy; getup on time, make breakfast for the kids, get them on the bus, start looking for a job,be nicer to Chris, don’t drink so much. Instead of isolating yourself pick up thephone and call a friend, get yourself out into the woods and go for a walk, start runningagain. Like all these little things that I was capableof but I couldn’t get out of here, could not get out of here and if you are stuck that’sthe problem. The problem is you are in your head, yourthinking. That is the universal problem and it all startswith this knowledge of what to do and then you hesitate and you think about whether ornot you feel like doing it. For a couple of months I was really stuck,Chris would get up at six I’d hit the snooze 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=886)~~  and then I’d hit the snooze and then I hitthe snooze the kids would miss the bus. Then every night I’d do the same thing I’dgo in bed, have ever had one of those nights probably before you started your company whereyou would go in bed and you are like, “All right Tom that’s it tomorrow it’s thenew me, tomorrow. Tomorrow I am going to get up on time, I amgoing to go to the gym, I am going to look for a job, I’m not going to drink so muchit’s going to be amazing. The new me, the future me whoa let’s dothis,” right? Then you go to bed and you wake up seven hourslater and you are like, “I don’t feel like the new me.” Tom: Who was that? Mel: Who the, that’s the stupidest … Seemotivation is garbage, it’s never there when you need it ever. Here is what happened to me and thank youfor wearing the NASA t-shirt. Tom: Of course. Mel: It’s a really stupid story. Tom: It’s a powerful story. Mel: One night Chris had gone to bed I hadbeen struggling, we still had all the same problems. I we still had the lien on the house, stillfacing bankruptcy, still fighting like crazy, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=951)~~  I was still unemployed. They still hadn’t figured out the solutionyet for the business and I was about to turn off the TV. There on the TV there was this rocket launchingand I thought, “Oh my gosh that is it. I am going to launch myself out of bed likea rocket ship like NASA right here and launch me out of that bed. I’m going to move so fast that I don’tthink. I’m going to beat my brain.” Now here is a really interesting point, Italk a lot about your instincts and inner wisdom and we can get into this a little bitlater. A lot of us talk about the fact that you havea gut feeling, but what all these research that I’ve done for the book and all thespeaking that I do. What I’ve discovered that’s fascinatingis actually when you set goals, when you have an intention on something that you want tochange about your life your brain helps you. What it does is it opens up a check list andthen your brain goes to work trying to remind you of that intention that you set. It’s really important to develop the skilland I say that word purposefully, the skill 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1026)~~  of knowing how to hear that inner wisdom andthat intention kicking in and leaning into it quickly. For me my brain saying, “That’s it rightthere move as fast as rocket Mel,” I wanted to change my life. I think most people that are miserable orthat are really dying to be great and dying to have more; we want to change, we want tolive a better life, we want to create more for our families, we want to be happier. The desire is there again it’s about howdo you go from knowledge to action. The first thing in this story that’s importantis realizing that the answer was in me and my mind was telling me, “Pay attention.” Could have also been the bourbon I mean Ihad had a couple of Manhattans that night. Anyway, the next morning the alarm goes offand I pretend that NASA was there. It’s the stupidest story I literally went;five, four, three, two, one I counted out loud and then I stood up. I’ll never forget standing there in my bedroom;it was dark, it was cold, it was winter in Boston. For the first time in three months I had beatenmy habit of hitting the snooze button. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1102)~~  I couldn’t believe it and I thought, “Waita minute counting backwards that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life.” Well the next morning I used it again andit worked. The next morning I used it again and it worked. The next morning I used it and it worked. Then I started to notice something reallyinteresting, there were moments all day long just like that five second moment in bed whereI knew knowledge what I should do. If I didn’t move within five seconds mybrain would step in and talk me out of it. Every human being has a five second windowmight even be shorter for you, you have about a five second window in which you can movefrom idea to action before your brain kicks in to full gear and sabotages any change inbehavior. Remember your brain is wired to stop you fromdoing things that are uncomfortable or uncertain or scary. It’s your job to learn how to move fromthose ideas that could change everything into acting on them in the smallest moment. Tom: For anyone right now at home who is thinkinglike this sounds too simple, too easy. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1179)~~  Talk a bit about your community, because readingsome of their comments it’s crazy how many people like the sheer volume of the peopleyou quote in your book. If you also go online and just look at thepeople that are directly reaching out to you, it is an avalanche of people that have storiesaround the five second rule. Mel: One of the reasons why I’m so excitedabout this book and look you don’t have to buy the book this is an idea that you canuse it’s free it’s backed by science, more than eight million people around theworld have discovered it. You are talking about the number of peoplewe’ve heard from more than a hundred thousand people in 80 countries …Tom: That’s crazy. Mel: ... that are using this rule. We know of 11 people who have stopped themselvesfrom killing themselves using this rule. Tom: I saw one of those outreaches which is… Mel: There is a guy Steve who wrote to uswho was a veteran. He was suffering from post-traumatic stressdisorder, he boarded a ferry overseas with the intention to jump over. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1232)~~  He walked over the railing and his inner wisdomkicked in. In that moment the five second rule; five,four, three, two, one counting backwards moved away from the railing asked for help savedhis life. His story has inspired countless other peoplethat have heard me in the speeches that I give around the world about this one tool. The thing that’s so cool about this, andI should tell you the science behind it because I’m going to be honest with you it is stupid. Had I ever thought that I would find myselfeight years after discovering it spending my days telling people about the five secondrule, first of all I would have picked a different name because it reminds you of the one whereyou have to pick up food in five seconds off the floor. Tom: Yeah. Mel: It was my secret weapon this was somethingI did, I never intended to tell anybody. I went from getting up on time and wakingup on time to shaking up my entire life. Because when you understand the power of afive second decision and you understand that you always have a choice to go from autopilotto decision maker everything in your life 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1304)~~  will change. You will be a different negotiator, you willdifferent in sales, you will be unstoppable on the gym because you will realize the amountof garbage that you put in the way; of your hopes, of your dreams, of your potential,of your confidence, of your courage. Everything comes down to the decision thatyou make. We all know what to do none of us know howto make ourselves do it. I started researching it why does somethingso stupid work, why? Why does something so silly create such powerfuland profound change? Well here is why, the rule is a form of metacognition. Metacognition is a fancy pants term that meanssomething real simple; you can out smart your own brain in furtherance of goals. Tom: Agree. Mel: There are tricks that you can use thatactually outsmart the tricks your brain plays on you. In furtherance of a higher purpose we allknow this, you can restrain yourself if you are in a situation that calls for it. You can jump into a raging river to save yourdog or your kid, you can direct yourself in 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1375)~~  ways if it’s important to you. The rule what it does is it does somethingreally remarkable. When you count backwards; five, four, three,two, one what you are actually doing is you are interrupting what researchers call habitloops that get in coded as close loop patterns in your basal ganglia. That’s the part of the brain where yourfeelings, where your emotions every habit that you have which is nothing more than behaviorthat you repeat that you don’t even think about. Tom: I’ve heard it referred to as a gearbox, because you shift your attention from [inaudible 00:23:28]. Mel: Yes, so when you go; five, four, three,two, one it interrupts what’s going on here that’s spinning without you thinking andit moves and awakens your prefrontal cortex. When you hit one your habit has been interruptedso you’ve interrupted self-doubt, you’ve interrupted maybe snapping at your kids, you’veinterrupted the desire to grab for drink, you’ve interrupted procrastination. You’ve also by counting backwards done anaction, it awakens your prefrontal cortex 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1440)~~  that is the part of the brain that’s awakewhen you are changing behavior, when you are learning new things. When you hit one it’s also a prompt. In the language of research you’ll hearpeople talk about starting rituals, that is something that’s proven to help you learna new habit. The five second rule when you repeat it becomesa starting ritual that triggers you to act with confidence, that triggers you that thisis a moment for courage, that triggers you to shift gears. Because you’ve also done the manual workof awakening the part of the brain that you need to change, you’ve set yourself up forsuccess. It doesn’t work if you count up becauseyou can keep going and also counting up doesn’t require a focus. If you count backwards; five, four, three,two, one it again awakens the prefrontal cortex and it prompts you to move. When you start to use it and then you readabout it you’ll see that it’s being used all over the place; they use it in the armedservices in order to align troops and get them to start an exercise, they use it inelementary schools; five, four, three, two, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1500)~~  one at big assemblies to get a huge room fullof kids to stop talking. Tom: Exactly, a really simple and interestingexample yeah. Mel: Because it requires you to focus it’snot a habit. It will become a habit that prompts you tohave confidence and courage, but in the beginning it interrupts patterns of behavior that youdo on autopilot, it helps you assert control and it teaches you how to become the kindof person that moves from thinking about something to actually doing it. Tom: It’s incredible so there is so manythings in that story and guys I’m telling you it’s, you are going to love the depthof brain research that is put in the book. It’s really quite extraordinary you reallyhave an amazing grasp of the brain and it really, really came through in the book. For me it was a wonderful balancing act betweenthe raw emotion of the people writing in and some of the stories that you are sharing andthe imagery of the rocket ship which you are very open about. It’s sort of a silly visual metaphor, butbecause it’s effective that silliness is

Mel: What’s incredible is in five secondsflat self-doubt can take over and rob you of your power and rob you of joy and rob youof your potential or in five seconds flat you can actually use one stupid little trickto push yourself to grab it. Tom: What I loved in the book is because youpaint the picture so very well you are also just a good writer, so you paint the picturelike I could feel the crisp winter air of Boston stalking you out of the under the comforter. I could really feel that I was there withyou as Chris’ business is struggling, so you really feel all of that. The moment when you do the countdown you springout of bed and you are almost like taking yourself by surprise and you are like movingbefore you realize it. But you are reading it from the perspectiveof I already knew who you were, so it was it gave me the chills. It was more difficult to picture you as stuckthan it was to know, “I know where she goes.” I had already seen the Ted Talk by the timeI read the book, I knew what you were doing 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1627)~~  from a media perspective, I knew how manypeople and companies you would help. For me it was like watching it in reverse,so I’m watching it from the safety of, “I know she crushes,” it so if this is thething and I love that this isn’t your first book. This was the secret that you planned to keephidden in the drawer forever. Mel: Yeah I was not going to tell anybodybecause it was stupid and it also worked so it was my thing and it’s not your thing. See the real thing that happened for me andthis is something that is a really important topic for me, is that there is when you talkabout personality so extroverts, introverts a lot of us really I know I did this I wasall wrong about what confidence meant. I thought confidence was a personality trait. Tom: I love this tell me more. Mel: I thought that people that are outgoingare the confident ones and the truth is confidence is not a personality trait at all, it’sa skill. A lot of the extroverted people that you knoware actually very insecure, I used to become 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1688)~~  of them. I used to be the kind of bossy class loudmouth; that didn’t believe in myself, that didn’t believe in my ideas, that didn’thave the confidence and the courage to really be the real me; who I am, who I’m not flawsand all. There are tremendous number of introvertedpeople that feel uncomfortable putting the attention on themselves, but they are very,very confident in their ideas. They definitely believe in themselves. When you start to separate confidence notas a matter of personality but as a skill that you can acquire because confidence isthe ability to move in my opinion from thought to action. Because when you are a confident person youbelieve enough in yourself and your capability that you are willing to try, that you arewilling to share. To me confidence isn’t the assuredness thatit turns out, it’s the willingness to try and that was a huge insight for me. What a lot of people don’t know about mealthough I share this on stage and I’m extremely open about this because this is a topic that’sreally important to me. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1760)~~  The single most profound use of the five secondrule is mind control and I say that as a lawyer. I will tell you, you can use this stupid trickto cure yourself of anxiety. Tom: Yeah I wanted to talk about that, soyou struggled very profoundly with anxiety so walk us through some nuts and bolts ofhow you use the five second rule. I think, so my hypothesis and he reason wefounded Impact Theory is that the world is living through two pandemics; the pandemicof the body which everybody understands because it’s so visual; being overweight, dyingof diet related diseases such as diabetes. Because the second pandemic the pandemic ofthe mind is invisible people don’t realize how pervasive a suicide is and I think it’sthe leading cause of death among young men I mean it’s crazy. Then that there are ways that they can goabout attacking that and fixing the problem, so walk us through that. Mel: Sure I would love to. First of all I literally have struggled withanxiety my entire life and anxiety for this conversation the way I define it is it isthe habit of worrying spiraled out of control. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1832)~~  You may say that you are a worrier that’snot true you have a habit of worrying. A habit is a pattern of behavior or thinkingthat you repeat without realizing it. Anxiety happens when that pattern of worryingabout things spirals out of control and now it starts to marry and manifest itself withphysical sensations too, that’s all that it is. I know that I said that that’s all thatit is. Me personally I struggled with anxiety I thinkmy entire life, it became quite acute when I was in my late teens and early twenties. I became medicated in the middle of law schoolI took Zoloft for two decades. When our first daughter was born who is now17 the postpartum depression and the cascading panic was so terrible that not only was Imedicated and couldn’t breast feed, but I couldn’t be left alone with her. Tom: Wow. Mel: When I say you can cure yourself of anxietyI don’t say that lightly. Four years ago after I had been using thefive second rule to change my behavior; how I spoke to my husband, how I negotiate inbusiness meetings, how I conduct sales, the 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1899)~~  kind of parent that I am, my health habits,my eating habits, curbing the drinking. I thought, “I wonder if I can use this;five, four, three, two, one thing to get control of my thought patterns.” Not my behavior patterns, my thought patternsyes you can. Tom: Wow. Mel: We’re going to build this conversationbecause I want to start with something that we can all relate to and that is how do youstop worrying and how do you stop listening to self-doubt, this is how you are going todo it. All day long you are going to have momentswhere your thoughts drift and I use that word on purpose. Because for me there is a physical sensationwhen you start to use the five second rule and you start to wake up, not only on timein the morning but you wake up to your life and the opportunities in your life. There is your thoughts drift, like you’lljust be hanging out with your friends and then suddenly you are like, “I’m not surethat that person likes me anymore. I haven’t heard from my kids lately I wonderif they are dead or I was going to check,” 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=1963)~~  you just start worrying about stuff why? Because it’s a habit. Because when you are not paying attentionyour brain shifts from you being a decision maker and paying attention to you just spendingthings on autopilot and one of your habits is worrying. The second you wake up and you notice, “Holycow I’m talking some negative garbage to myself right now,” five, four, three, two,one you’ve just shifted the part of the brain that you are using. You have shifted from the basal ganglia whichis where your habit loops are spinning and you have awakened your prefrontal cortex. You’ve also interrupted that pattern. Now what you are going to do because yourmind is actually ready to receive a different thought because of the counting, now you canput in an anchor thought. Like if you have a mantra, if you have a visionabout the way that your business is going to turn out in five years. If you just have a thought that makes youreally happy and proud insert that. Now why does this work? It works because of the counting and I’mnot kidding. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2030)~~  We know based on research the positive thinkingalone not effective. In some instances trying to force yourselfto think positive can actually make the worries worse, why? Well the reason why is because it’s reallyhard to just change the channel, what we have to do first is basically interrupt it andturn off the TV and then turn it back on with the prefrontal cortex awakened, so the countingis essential. You can start using this today, you catchyourself talking garbage to yourself because we all know if I were to put a speaker onyour head and broadcast you wouldn’t be sitting here in the audience you would bein an insane asylum because the crap that you say to yourself is insane. The problem is we listen to it, you’ll bein a sales meeting and you’ll be undermining yourself, “They are not going to buy ohmy gosh I’m in trouble,” you are not even present; five, four, three, two, one switchit back. Get back to that vision that you have abouttoasting your success or this customer being really happy or you being proud of yourself. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2091)~~  Whatever that vision may be you can controlyour thoughts and this is not just us talking about it, this is a tool that you can use. Let’s take it a step further, so worryingif you let it go unchecked what will happen is you will get used to worrying. You will get used to living in a state whereyou are slightly agitated all the time. Let me talk a little bit about agitation,so what we know based on research is that physically in your body so physiologicallybeing excited is the exact same thing as being afraid. Let me say that again because it is so important;in your body being excited is the exact same thing as being afraid. Your body doesn’t know the damn difference;your heart races, your armpits sweat, you may get tight in your throat, you may yourcheeks may get pink like mine do when I get excited. The only difference between excitement andfear is what your brain says and the problem is if you have a habit of worrying, guesswhat you are going to tell yourself is going on that you are freaking out. That you are not excited that something mustbe wrong, oh gosh why would you say something 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2168)~~  is wrong because you got a habit of sayingthat all the time. Even as I became a speaker for a living whereI would be on CNN when I first started doing it I would be freaking out back stage. Even though like just last week he is standingback stage about to go on 8,000 people; heart races, armpits sweat, my hands get clammyI’m not nervous though not at all I’m excited. I developed this technique and research outof Harvard not based on my technique but something very similar proofs that if you basicallyright before you are about to do something; take a test, run a race, pubic speaking, abusiness negotiation, ask somebody to marry you. Whatever it may be that gets your heart racingjust do this go, “I’m excited. I’m excited to give that speech, I’m excitedto ask him or her, I’m excited to do this race, I’m excited.” What happens is you give your brain contextso your brain doesn’t escalate the stuff going on in your body, your brain is not worriedmakes sense? Tom: Yeah. Mel: You can combine this with the five secondrule. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2234)~~  We know how to do worrying you catch yourthoughts through a; five, four, three, two, one anchor thought. If you start to feel your heart racing; five,four, three, two, one to awaken the prefrontal cortex and then start going, “I’m reallyexcited to do this.” Another technique that you can use is askI think they call it interrogatory questions where instead of giving yourself a pep talksay, “Well why I’m I ready to do this? Why I’m I ready?” Because that will force you to answer thequestion which then convinces you. “Why I’m I ready to close this sale, whyI’m I ready to give this speech, why I’m I ready?” Those are two strategies that you can usebacked by science that are proven to actually make your performance be much better. Now let’s take it a step further to anxiety. Anxiety is what happens when the habit ofworrying spins out of control, your body gets really agitated and then you allow your mindto escalate it into a full blown panic attack. For those of you that have not had the pleasureof having a panic attack let me explain what 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2299)~~  it’s like. Have you ever been in your car and you aredriving down the road and you go to change lanes and then all of a sudden there is likeoh my God there is a car right here. You swerve a little bit and then your heartis like and you may sweat a little bit and you grip the wheel really tight and you aresuper locked in on the road ahead of you. Then that car pulls away and the near missscenario passes and your mind starts going, “Okay you are all right now that’s it.” That’s what a panic attack is only it happenswhile you are standing in front of your coffee pot, seriously. You have that same, “Oh my God [inaudible00:38:55],” and your heart’s racing and the problem for your brain is that your braincan’t look around and say, “Holy cow we almost got hit by a car.” Your brain is saying, “What the hell iswrong with her, she is making coffee and she is freaking out,” so now your brain is theproblem because what’s our brain’s job it’s designed to protect you. Your brain will now do whatever it can tomagnify the problem remember we talked about 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2363)~~  the spotlight effect. It will start telling you all kinds of crazystuff because it can’t figure out contextually, “What the hell is going on she is just makingcoffee now her heart is racing and she is breathing really, holy cow maybe she is havinga heart attack.” A lot of people that have panic attacks say,“I think I’m dying oh my God what’s happening,” or you see them do the deerin the headlights thing where they got to get out of the room. That is the spotlight effect in your brainnow taking control and magnifying everything to get you out of whatever it was. Here is how you use the second rule; you useit to stabilize your thoughts before the panic escalates. Then what happens is it drifts into worryand then it disappears. The second you feel worry you catch it youtrain yourself to do that. If you start feeling yourself getting yourheat racing you can; five, four, three, two, one and use the, “I’m excited, I’m excited.” If that doesn’t work literally; five, four,three, two, one and just give yourself an 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2423)~~  anchor thought literally of you being okay. I’ll give you another quick example becausethis is one that we have a tremendous number of success with and people that hear the exampleuse it immediately and are blown away. I used to be terrified of flying, terrifiedevery bump I’d be freaking out. I started using this strategy with the plane,so the second that you feel yourself getting nervous; five, four, three, two, one and thenyour anchor thought is a vision of what you are going to do when you get to where youare going. When I get on the plane tomorrow to fly backto Boston I’ll think about walking in the house and the place is like a disaster. It’ll look like everybody’s stuff gotloaded into a can and then fired all over the first floor. If we hit turbulence; five, four, three, two,one I’ll think about that vision because cognitively for my brain if I’m walkingin the house and it’s a disaster the plane made it that’s the power of this. It’s incredible. Tom: What I love about you Mel is that a,I love how raw and real you are about your 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2484)~~  own situation which … Because people aregoing to look at you and the first thing they are going to want to do is make you extraordinaryway not to have to live up to your standard because what you have accomplished reallyis astonishing and seeing you on stage is unbelievable. You are so good at that and I know that itcomes from working your ass off but wow it’s very, very impressive. Mel: Thank you. Tom: Then that you use techniques like thatyou’ve got answers for how have I done this I’ve done it like this and I’ve had castsit across to me that that’s not their stake. Like they have done truly extraordinary thingswith their life but they seem just like totally blind to how they did it. The fact that you can walk people throughit is so cool. Mel: Well I think we are all flawed and that’sthe beauty of who you are. Instead of trying to make yourself perfectin every area it’s so much easier when you accept the things that you are terrible ator that are your weaknesses or that are things about your wiring. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2541)~~  Look if I were diabetic I would take insulinI happen to be somebody that’s wired for anxiety no big deal. Figure out how to instead of fighting thosethings actually trick it, because the truth is that you are never going to feel readyto make these changes. You are never going to feel like doing thembut you can always make a decision that’s always in your control. Staying with somebody that treats you likegarbage is a decision, it is. Staying at a job that you hate is a decision. Staying in the body that you are not proudof is a decision. Is it going to be easy? No it’s not going to be easy to change it’ssimple, do a Google search and then use the five second rule to force yourself to do thatstuff. Change comes down to five second decisionsand this is why the five second rule is important for everybody to know. It’s your job to push yourself and I don’tcare if you are Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or you are Michelangelo or you are Lin-ManuelMiranda who wrote Hamilton you will struggle with self-doubt. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2616)~~  Everybody that you admire everybody and thelist is the same; Oprah Winfrey and I want to be like Tom and I want to be like Bransonand I want to be like Jay-Z and I want like … Everybody is listed as a Bill Gates. Do you know what those people do, they donot have the habit of hesitating they trust themselves. Tom: Now really fast before we go tell usabout the million dollar mornings and setting yourself up. Mel: Yes, I have a gift. Here is the thing I did one thing other thanthe five second rule that has changed my life, my marriage everything. I do not have the phone in my bedroom. The phone is designed by people like yourphone you should not have your phone in your bedroom and here is why; because what’son your phone is not your dreams. What’s on your phone is stuff that’s beendesigned by people that studied game theory. You know why you check your email all thetime? You know why you are constantly looking atyour phone? It’s called random rewards. It’s a psychological principal that explainswhy we pull slot machines, because every six 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2676)~~  or seven times we get a little random rewardso we keep going back. I know most emails blow but every once ina while you get a good one that’s why you keep looking. I created this course called The Million DollarMorning; whether you want to make a million dollars a year or in a morning or whetheryou want to wake up and feel like a million bucks. This is the science backed strategy step bystep for how to wake up because it’s not when you wake up that matters it’s how youwake up that matters. We filmed it at the house I walk you throughall the science, I show you the whole routine and we’re giving it to your audience forfree. Tom: Wow thank you. Mel: You are welcome, because look I wantyou to use things. It’s one thing to talk, talk, talk and thinkit’s another thing to actually take action. The more that you can provide, that I canprovide that shows people what to do and the more tools that we can give people to getout of their heads and into action the more the world is going to improve, the more yourlife will improve. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2742)~~  Tom: All right I get the feeling that thiswhole time has sort of been answering this question but I’m going to ask it anyway;what’s the impact that you want to have on the world? Mel: The impact that I want to have is I wantto teach people how to discover the power that’s inside of them. To live fully in the open and share themselves;who they are, who they are not like there is so much fear that we live with. I want to teach people how to live with morecourage because courage is nothing more than the ability to do things that are uncertain. In today’s world we have the internet youcan literally learn, launch, do anything. The only thing that’s truly stopping youare the limiting patterns that you think; the self-doubt, the fear, the habits thatyou have and you can break them. You can break them five seconds at a time. The impact that I want to have is I want toteach people a simple way to discover the power that’s locked inside them and thento unleash it and go out and live the life they’ve always dreamt of. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2824)~~  Tom: Awesome Mel thank you so much for [crosstalk00:47:07]. Mel: I want a hug get over there. Tom: Got it. Guys you are going to want to dive into thevery warm waters that are this woman’s world. It is absolutely astonishing I’m talkingraw vulnerability but what I love is no matter how silly some of the things she may say theyare, they are incredibly powerful. You will see her community they will reachout, you will see them talking about how they have changed in real time whether it’s steppingback of a ledge and not making a catastrophically bad decision. Whether it’s just truly jumping out of bedand attacking their life, unleashing the power that they have within themselves to live thelife they were meant to live, to finally own what they actually want which is somethingthat she really, really encourages everybody to do especially our community. It is unbelievable and you guys will benefitso tremendously from somebody who is able to convey the difference between motivationwhich is bullshit and action which is real. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHPSo79rB4&t=2890)~~  That is where she has made a name for herself,she is all about action you guys. Heard it today she breaks things down intothe not always easy but the always simple steps and if you follow those steps you willbe able to transform your life really in five seconds or less. It’s absolutely breathtaking she backs everythingup with science. Mel where can they find you online?
