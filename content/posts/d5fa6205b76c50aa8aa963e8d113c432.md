**The DAX language**
====================



 The DAX language was created specifically for the handling of data models, through the use of formulas and expressions. DAX is used in several Microsoft Products such as Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Analysis Services and Microsoft Power Pivot for Excel. These products all share the same internal engine, called Tabular. 
 

Functions
---------


Browse DAX functions alphabetically from the sidebar or choose a category below:


* [Aggregation functions](https://dax.guide/functions/aggregation/)
Aggregation functions return a scalar value applying an aggregation function to a column or to an expression evaluated by iterating a table expression.
* [Date and Time functions](https://dax.guide/functions/date-time/)
Date and time functions help creating calculations based on dates and time. Many of the functions in DAX are similar to the Excel date and time functions.
* [Filter functions](https://dax.guide/functions/filter/)
Filter functions manipulate table and filter contexts.
* [Financial functions](https://dax.guide/functions/financial/)
Financial functions corresponding to Excel functions with the same name.
* [Information functions](https://dax.guide/functions/information/)
Information functions provide information about data type or filter context of the argument provided.
* [Logical functions](https://dax.guide/functions/logical/)
Logical functions act upon an expression to return information about the values or sets in the expression.
* [Math and Trig functions](https://dax.guide/functions/math-trig/)
The mathematical functions in DAX are very similar to the Excel mathematical and trigonometric functions.
* [Other functions](https://dax.guide/functions/other/)
These are special functions that cannot be classified in other categories.
