# Description 
Simple method to organize ALL MUSICAL SCALES of harmonies. We use a simple method based on families and circular interval patterns to organize all scales that are well suited for building up harmonies: "THE SCALES OF HARMONIES". We explore and systematize the Major Modes, Melodic minor Modes, Harmonic minor Modes, Harmonic Major Modes, Diminished Modes, Whole tone Mode and Augmented Modes.
