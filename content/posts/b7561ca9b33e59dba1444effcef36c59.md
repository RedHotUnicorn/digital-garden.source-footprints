Network elaborated in Graphia App by the author.

Graphia is a powerful open source visual analytics application developed to aid the interpretation of large and complex datasets. Graphia can create and visualize graphs from tables of numeric data and display the structures that result. It can also be used to visualize and analyze any data that is already in the form of a graph [1].

Graphia is designed and built by a small dedicated group of scientists working in Edinburgh, Scotland. They are passionate about graphs, the power of visualization and creating tools that aid the interpretation of complex data [1,2]
