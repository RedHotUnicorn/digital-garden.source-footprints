Who am I?
---------

I'm [Daniel Nguyen](https://twitter.com/daniel_nguyenx). In June, I quit my consulting job to start indie hacking on the side.

The idea of KTool first came to my mind when I was reading [Ask HN: I'm a software engineer going blind, how should I prepare?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980)

I've been wearing glasses since I was 5. My right eye is basically blind. Doctors said there is no chance to cure it.

I was genuinely scared. Like holy sh\*t, if my left eye stops working, my life is done. Since then I've been very conscious about time spent on computer screens.

That's when I started using Kindle-related products: to offload as many reading materials as possible to the Kindle.

Then I ran into multiple limitations which led me to build KTool: a tool to send anything online to Kindle. Blog posts, Twitter threads, Hacker News discussions, RSS, newsletters, your favorite manga... you name it.

If you're a Kindle owner and read a lot of online content, give [KTool](https://ktool.io) a try.
