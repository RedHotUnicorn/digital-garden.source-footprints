`update-index --skip-worktree`
==============================


The specific `git` option to **ignore** configuration files is:



```
$ git update-index --skip-worktree <filepath>

```

Note that there is **no need to add something to** `.gitignore`.


**To cancel** this, for example when the generic structure of a configuration file has changed:



```
$ git update-index --no-skip-worktree <filepath>

```

`--skip-worktree` is used to instruct `git` not to index a file change to a specific file ever. This might be because developers usually need to change the file locally in order to test the project. For example, if the main repository upstream hosts a production-ready configuration file and accidental commit changes to this file should be prevented.


Whereas `--assume-unchanged` assumes that a developer should never change that file. This flag is meant only for improving the performance of `git` with respect to never changing folders like software development kit (SDK) components.
