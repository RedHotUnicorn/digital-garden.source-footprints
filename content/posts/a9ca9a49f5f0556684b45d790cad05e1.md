#### AIConfig

![](/images/aiConfig.png)Version control and optimize prompts with AIConfig
--------------------------------------------------

Version, evaluate & optimize prompts and model parameters with an open-source framework that manages prompts as YAML configs.

Use **AIConfig SDK** to decouple model-specific logic from your application code and swap model providers with ease. Use **AIConfig Editor** as a universal prompt playground to optimize prompts for 

any model or modality, including text, image and audio.
