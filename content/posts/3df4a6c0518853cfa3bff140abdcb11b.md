The dreaded rejection email. By now, I was quite used to it. It was as if I would apply to jobs to get rejected. I’ve got a lot of rejection mails throughout my career. At first, I used to get really disappointed whenever I got a rejection mail. But as time went on, I sort of got used to them. In fact, nowadays, I try to enjoy the creativity of the HR team while reading the rejection mails. Most HRs try to make it sound as sweet as they can. Some of them would say that the requirements of the job and the skills of the candidate do not match. Some would console, saying that they’re sure there are better opportunities elsewhere. And some would outright say you are not good enough.

So what does a Data Scientist do when he receives a lot of rejection emails? Build a classifier that automatically sorts emails indicating rejection into the reject category and the other emails into not-reject category. Let me detail out the process so that you can do the same.

I started with collecting data from my own inbox. I thought of collecting emails programmatically using relevant keywords like ‘thank you for your application’, ‘we wish you a great future’ from my inbox, but then decided against it since I didn’t exactly know if they were the right / only keywords. I browsed through my inbox manually, and extracted the texts from reject emails. I also collected an equal amount of emails randomly which did not contain any rejection. I gathered both these categories of email texts together and saved it in a csv file.

One of the issues with data collection for this task is that I do not have a lot of rejection emails. Many companies simply do not send any rejection email. Some of them send a rejection message on their portal. As a result, we have very limited number of rejection emails.he fact that despite being rejected many times, In our case, we have around 10 rejection emails. This is, by no means, enough for a robust classifier. But let’s try and build one with the resources at our disposal.

After data collection, we proceed to the data preprocessing stage. In this stage, we first convert all the uppercase characters to lowercase characters since the computer treats each case differently. After that, we remove punctuations since they do not contribute to the classifier. And then, we remove numbers, since they do not contribute to the classifier as well.

Once the data has been preprocessed, it has to be converted into a form that can be used for machine learning. There are multiple techniques of converting texts into matrices of numbers. Some of them include Count Vectorizer, Tf-Idf Vectorizer and bag of words. In our case, we make use of Count Vectorizer as it was almost comparable to Tf-Idf Vectorizer.

We also encode our target variable, which is the label (reject or not reject) using sklearn’s LabelEncoder. This encodes reject and not reject as 0 and 1 respectively.

We then split our data into training and testing sets using sklearn’s train\_test\_split. We label our training data, x\_train and y\_train and our testing data, x\_test and y\_test.

We use a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier model to fit the training data. After that we write a function to convert the encoded categories back to their names and use the predict function on the test data. We obtain an accuracy of around 80 % on the test data.

We also test our classifier by giving custom input statements to see how it performs. Here are a few predictions.

Awesome! Of course, it isn’t perfect, but it certainly seems to recognize the pattern of rejection emails. With more data, I am sure it can be made more robust. Further, I’d like to explore if I can integrate this with my gmail account.

P.S. If you would like to go through the code, I’ve uploaded it on Github as an Ipython notebook.
