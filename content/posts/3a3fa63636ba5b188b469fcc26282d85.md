At the end of each whirlwind year, it’s hard to decipher where the last 365 days went. Complete an annual review to pause and consider how you spent your past year –– the highs, the lows, and everything in between.


Use this Todoist template to review all the important aspects of your life: work, productivity, health, finances, relationships, and learning.


**Tip:** Use the task [comments](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-comments-and-file-uploads) to add your answers to reflection prompts and review questions.
