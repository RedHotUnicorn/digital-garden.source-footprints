======================

A place to make sense of the world and create amazing things.

It's free. No credit card required.Our computers made us think like them
-------------------------------------

We adapted our thinking and the way we work to computers:

Faceless files with cryptic names and a multitude of programs to use them hinder our work every day.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Our units of thinking are objects such as books, people, conversations, or ideas.

Say goodbye to files and enter the intuitive world of objects.

Folders and hierarchies limit our creativity
--------------------------------------------

They silo our thinking. They are too rigid to structure our dynamic, diverse, and interconnected work.

--------------------------------------------

Connecting objects allows you to naturally structure information.

This helps you understand complex topics and might even

spark new ideas where you donât expect them.

We are drowning in a flood of information
-----------------------------------------

Social media, notifications, and other constant distractions.

Our environment makes us less productive, more stressed, and less happy.
