RAS Syndrome
============

RAS Syndrome is Redundant Acronym Syndrome Syndrome. It's when an acronym is followed by a word that's also part of the acronym.

Some examples you may come across:

* ATM machine - *Automated Teller Machine*
* PIN number - *Personal Identification Number*
* ISBN number - *International Standard Book Number*
* PDF format - *Portable Document Format*
* LCD display - *Liquid Crystal Display*
* HIV virus - *Human Immunodeficiency Virus*
* DC Comics - *Detective Comics*
* RSVP please - *Répondez S'il Vous Plaît — Reply please*
* MLS soccer - *Major League Soccer*
* PAT testing - *Portable Appliance Testing*

While, in principle, the following word is redundant were we to spell out the acronym, that we tend to include it in everyday speech means it's usually serving a helpful function. Quite often, it's clarifying what you're talking about given many people won't know what the acronym actually stands for (see [TLAs](https://sketchplanations.com/ask-the-question)).

By the way, ATM is technically an [initialism](https://sketchplanations.com/acronyms-and-initialisms), while PIN is an acronym.

I'd guess you've probably come across RAS Syndrome, too. However, I didn't realise there was a name for it until recently, even though it was coined in New Scientist magazine back in 2001.
