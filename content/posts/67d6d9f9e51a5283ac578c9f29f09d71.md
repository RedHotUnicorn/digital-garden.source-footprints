The language learning app sector was imported from the desktop courses which were available in the mid-2000s, which offered classes through CDs, desktop apps or, as was new and trendy at the time, on the web.

 [Babbel](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/babbel-statistics/) and [Busuu](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/busuu-statistics/) were part of this initial wave of language learning web apps, but Rosetta Stone was still the premier-service, which had offered language learning CDs since the early 1990s.

 What several of these new language learning services offered was free courses or community-built lessons. The founders of Duolingo were especially focused on building a language app that could be accessed by anyone in the world.

Some languages have even been saved from extinction through the courses published by these apps.

 Building language learning apps for mobile led to the gamification of the sector, with prizes for finishing a course, flashcards, health bars and other gaming features to make learning a language informal and fun.

 That has led to criticism from some, although research has shown that the gamification of language learning can lead to improved outcomes for learners. It also enables new forms of learning which are uncommon in classrooms and overnight courses.

 Several of these apps have seen their revenues double in the past two years, as more people around the world learn their second or third language on mobile. During the coronavirus pandemic, some saw a surge in educational usage, as schools looked to use apps as homework.

 That said, approximately five percent of language learning is done on mobile, the other 90 percent is still offline. One issue with relying fully on apps is that most are not sophisticated enough for learners to reach fluent stage, meaning they need to take courses after learning on the app to become fully fluent in another language.

 Other apps, such as HelloTalk and Tandem, have tried to fix this by letting users have conversations with native speakers. If the user gets a sentence wrong, these apps provide instant feedback either from the native speaker or using AI.

 We have collected data and statistics on the language learning sector. Read on below to find out more.
