============


A free, open-source alternative to Mathematica®


[![](images/mathicsserver.png)](#django)

[![](images/mathics-manual.png)](#doc)
Mathics is a free, open-source general-purpose computer
 algebra system featuring Mathematica®-compatible syntax and
 functions. It relies on a number of other Python libraries
 in the Python ecosystem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 [Status as of September 2021](sept-21-status.html)


Components
----------




 Mathics has a modular design, allowing to reuse parts of it
 and run them with tailored dependencies and minimal footprint.
 


To run the full Mathics, a complete Docker image is available at
 [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathicsorg/mathics).
 


To install everything locally without Docker, use the
 [Mathics-omnibus Python package](https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-omnibus/)
 available from the Python package index.
 


The pieces that make up Mathics are described below, along with their
 dependencies, be they system package or Python package dependencies.
 


### Mathics Core



 The Mathics core is required for any work with Mathics.
 



 If you are developing a non-interactive application written in
 Mathics, you may need no more than this.
 



 Code repository: [mathics-core on GitHub](https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-core)



### mathicsscript



 mathicsscript is a fancier command-line client for Mathics.
 



![](images/mathicsscript1.gif)


 mathicsscript features:
 


* terminal interaction using either
 [prompt\_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable)
 or GNU Readline. This includes
	+ saving command history between sessions
	+ variable completion, even for symbol names like
	 `\[Sigma]`
	+ limited `ESC` keyboard input; for example
	 `ESC`+`p`+`ESC` is `π`
* syntax highlighting using pygments
* automatic detection of light or dark terminal background color.
* entering and displaying Unicode symbols such as used for Pi or
 Rule arrows


* Code repository: [mathicsscript on GitHub](https://github.com/Mathics3/mathicsscript/)
* Python package: [mathicsscript on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mathicsscript)


### Mathics-Django



 This is a browser-based webserver with MathML-formatted output
 and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) graphics.
 


![](images/mathicsserver.png)

 It features:
 


* extensive online documentation and interactive documentation via
 Ajax
* integrated graphics and MathML mathematics output via MathJax and Three.js
* notebook-like sessions



 To use this, you will need Django installed and a browser with
 JavaScript enabled.
 


* Code repository: [Mathics-Django on GitHub](https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-django/)
* Python package: [Mathics-Django on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mathics-django)
