Thanks to everyone who has been sharing this project with others!

Goal
----


Create the best existing intelligent file manager & productivity app that will significantly speed up your workflow, provide you with advanced tools, and keep your data safe.


`Done 21 of 100` major features.


Features
--------


#### The list of major features:


* **SMART GLOBAL SEARCH:** feature allows you to find any file / directory on your computer in just a few seconds. It also implements a typo correction system, allowing you to find files even when the search query includes typos, wrong case, wrong word order, missing words, missing symbols, and missing file extension.
* **TABS:** feature allows you to quickly switch between multiple directories with a click or a shortcut.
* **WORKSPACES:** feature allows you to create separate workspaces with their own tabs and pre-defined actions, allowing you to quickly switch between them. Actions can perform different operations, e.g. open a website, run a script, open a file in a specific program, etc.
* **ADVANCED WIRELESS FILE SHARING:** share a directory or stream any file to your local devices wirelessly without installing any apps. It works on any device with a modern web browser (smart TVs, mobile devices, laptops, virtual machines, etc).
* **ADDRESS BAR:** lets you quickly navigate directories with your keyboard. It autocompletes file names and automatically opens directories as you type.
* **ITEM FILTER:** allows you to filter out items from the list to quickly find the one you need. It supports advanced glob patterns and property prefixes.
* **ADVANCED FILE DOWNLOADER:** stream / download any file from the internet just by dragging it (or its URL link) onto the app. It supports all file types, including videos from video services like Youtube and video streams (with or without auth tokens / URL timestamps).
* **SMART DRAG & DROP:** allows you to easily download files from the internet, and provides a comfortable way of copying / moving local files.
* **SHORTCUTS:** most actions within the app can be performed with shortcuts. You can also create global (system wide) shortcuts for some actions like opening / hiding the app or opening the app and instantly creating a new note.
* **CUSTOMIZABLE HOME PAGE BANNER:** The home page of the app has a unique, recognizable feature - a customizable media background (banner). You can set a custom image / video or choose one of the built-in artworks (kindly provided to me by different artists) and personalize the app to your liking.
* **NOTES:** Advanced note editor in this app allows you to create featureful notes and store them in one convenient, quickly accessible place.
* **DASHBOARD:** Dashboard page provides quick access to pinned / protected / tagged items, and the timeline.
* **FILE PROTECTION:** This feature allows you to protect any file / directory / note from being modified / renamed / moved / deleted.
* **INFO PANEL:** displays useful information about currently selected file / directory and the file preview for media files: audio, video, images (including animated gifs, apng, webp, and many other formats).
* **ARCHIVER:** built-in archiver allows you to compress files into archives and extract existing archives. It supports all most popular formats. See the list of formats on the ["features" wiki page](https://github.com/aleksey-hoffman/sigma-file-manager/wiki/Features)
* **AUTO UPDATES:** the app updates itself automatically. It will let you decide if and when you want to download and install an update.
* **COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION:** unlike closed-sourced apps, you participate in the development of this app (request features, vote which features should be prioritized, participate in discussions, modify code of the app yourself).
* **QUICK VIEW:** allows you to quickly open selected files in a preview window, rather than an external program by pressing `Space` button. It supports images, videos, audio, PDF, most plain text formats.
* **INFUSIVE DESIGN:** this app implements my custom, modern, beautiful, minimalistic, customizable, design system called "Infusive design".
* **WINDOW TRANSPARENCY EFFECTS:** feature allows you to customize the app design and create literally infinite amount of custom, beautiful, modern UI designs by allowing you to beautifully infuse any image / video into every element of the app UI.
* **LOCALIZATION:** the app interface can be displayed in any language. The languages can be edited, and new languages can be added by the community.

The funding will be used for funding the development of this and my other big projects. I'm also working in collaboration with a few universities on a project that will help scientists speed up development of new medications and treatments for diseases, reducing the time need to find a new medication from 10 years (current average) to just a few months, and hopefully help humanity get rid of diseases (the project will be open-sourced later);

#### âš¡ Requirements:


* **Memory (RAM):** minimum: ~100 MB, average: ~400 MB;
* **Storage:** minimum: ~370 MB;
* **OS:** 64-bit: Windows, Linux;


#### ðŸ“Ž Download links:


You can install the app in one of these ways:




| Operating system | Download link (latest version) |
| --- | --- |
| Windows (via winget) | `winget install --id=AlekseyHoffman.Sigma-File-Manager --source winget` |
| Windows (via Microsoft store) |  |
| Windows (unsigned installable) | [Installable file (.exe)](https://github.com/aleksey-hoffman/sigma-file-manager/releases/download/v1.7.0/Sigma-File-Manager-1.7.0-Windows-Setup.exe) |
| Debian (Ubuntu) portable app | experimental | [AppImage](https://github.com/aleksey-hoffman/sigma-file-manager/releases/download/v1.7.0/Sigma-File-Manager-1.7.0-Linux-Debian.AppImage) |
| If there's no compiled binary for your Linux dist, you can build the app from the source code yourself, using `Node v15.14.0` | `npm run build` |


### Info


This app is primarily developed for Windows. The Linux builds get a lot less development time. They are less stable and have more issues. With more supporters, I will be able to spend more time on Linux builds.


#### Windows | Installation notes


It's recommended to install the app via the Microsoft store.
If you decide to install the `Installable file (.exe)` instead, you might see a security warning during installation. If you see the warning prompt, click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"**.


#### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Installation notes


[Running AppImage applications in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://itsfoss.com/cant-run-appimage-ubuntu/)
#### âš  Notes:


* If you're running the app on the integrated GPU, the RAM usage will increase during video playback. Videos playing in the background (e.g. on the home page) are the main reason for high memory usage. You can reduce memory usage by choosing a static image for the "Windows transparency effect" and the home banner.
* The app is still in early development (prototyping) stage. It is safe to use, it should not delete or damage any files by itself, but it's recommended to backup (copy) your important data to an external backup drive or to your cloud storage, just for good practice.
* Expect to see some errors and performance issues in the first versions of the app. I will be fixing the problems gradually as they get reported by the users.
* The app has not been optimized yet, RAM usage can spike and go over 1 GB during some operations. So, for now, avoid using the app on low-tier computers (i.e. computers with 4 GB of RAM or less).

There's a fun secret hidden somewhere in the app. See if you can find it. Hint: only the dinosaur knows about it.
