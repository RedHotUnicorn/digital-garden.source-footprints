Fig is sunsetting, migrate to Amazon Q
--------------------------------------

Dear Fig users,  
  
Effective September 1, 2024 we will be ending access to Fig.  
  
We encourage users to migrate to [Amazon Q for command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-getting-started-installing.html). Itâ€™s free on the Individual tier and is designed to be faster and more reliable than Fig. To make this transition as easy as possible, users can upgrade to Amazon Q for command line directly from the Fig dashboard.  
  
To learn more about the changes to Fig and how to export your data, read our [blog post](/blog/post/fig-is-sunsetting).  
  
With hundreds of thousands of users, 22k GitHub stars, 13k Discord members, 400+ open source contributors, and 5 products, we are incredibly proud of what we accomplished. We are incredibly thankful to our community for their support, and we are excited to continue our journey with you at Amazon as part of Amazon Q.  
  
- Brendan, Matt, and the Fig team
