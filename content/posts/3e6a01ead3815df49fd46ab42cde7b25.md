![]()Getting started with data journalism can be tricky, especially if you’re unsure of the best way to start working with your first dataset, or even where to start looking for your first dataset.

At Media Hack, we’ve been working with data and journalism for the past five years. In that time the number of tools and learning materials for data journalism has increased exponentially, to the point where there are so many options available that just getting started can be bogged down in decision making.

This list of tools and resources is based on our experience working in this area. It includes tools that we have used, that we regularly use or know to be useful to anyone looking to perfect their data journalism.

We will update this list at regular intervals, so if you know of anything that may be worth including please email us ([info@mediahack.co.za](mailto:info@mediahack.co.za)). We can’t include everything but we would like to keep the list as up-to-date as possible.
