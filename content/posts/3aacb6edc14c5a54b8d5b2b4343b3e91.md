> You give it network data, and it gives you a visualization. No settings. No skills needed.

Gephisto‚Äôs design exemplifies how we can interfere with a user‚Äôs utilitarian goals, by giving them what they wish (an easy way to get a network map) but in disobedient ways (the produced map is different every time the tool is used) that encourage them to engage further with the tool‚Äôs methodological tenets. As an apparatus, Gephisto aims to incentivize untrained users to become more critical of their network mapping practices [2].

Same file, different network vizualizations
===========================================

With Gephisto we can change the network visualization as many times as we want. The following illustration shows 3 different network visualizations made with the same file.
