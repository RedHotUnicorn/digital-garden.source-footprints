Welcome to Schema.org
=====================



 Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create,
 maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the
 Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
 



 Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings,
 including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover
 entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can
 easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use
 Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages.
 Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others
 already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
 



 Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex,
 Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open [community](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg) process,
 using the [public-schemaorg@w3.org](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg)
 mailing list and through [GitHub](http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg).
 



 A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide
 on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.
 It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the
 larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
