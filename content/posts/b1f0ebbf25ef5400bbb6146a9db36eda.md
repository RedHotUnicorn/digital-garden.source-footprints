Overnight success
=================

Twitter co-founder Biz Stone is fond of saying:

"Timing, perseverance and ten years of trying will eventually make you seem like an overnight success."

Rarely have I heard someone so clearly articulate both what it usually takes to do well at something and how commonly we misrepresent the path to success.

Biz Stone explains his story in [Things a Little Bird Told Me](https://amzn.to/46zNz38).
