Our vision
----------

Unified Content Management

Imagine a world where Markdown isn‚Äôt just text ‚Äì it's a source of structured and unstructured data. With MarkdownDB, we aim to balance the simplicity and accessibility of writing in Markdown with the **ability to query your collection of markdown files like a database** ‚Äì think get me all files "with type Blog" or "all documents created in the last week" or "all documents with 'hello world' in the title" or find "all tasks (i.e. `- [ ]`) in all documents with ‚è≠Ô∏è emoji in the task".

Quickstart
----------

Start using MarkdownDB in just a few steps

### You have a folder of markdown content

For example, your blog posts. Each file can have a YAML frontmatter header with metadata like title, date, tags, etc.

### Index the files with MarkdownDB

Use the npm `mddb` package to index Markdown files into an SQLite database. This will create a `markdown.db` file in the current directory.

### Query your files with SQL...

E.g. get all the files with with tag `a`.

### ...or using MarkdownDB Node.js API in a framework of your choice!

Use our Node API to query your data for your blog, wiki, docs, digital garden, or anything you want!

### Build your blog, wiki, docs, digital garden, or anything you want

And share it with the world!
