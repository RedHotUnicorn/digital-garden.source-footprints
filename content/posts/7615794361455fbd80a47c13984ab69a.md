Advanced Todoist tips & tricks
==============================

Published on 04 Oct 2018 in  [productivity](/tags/productivity/)Last updated on 18 Feb 2020I've been using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) almost daily for the last 4 years. I've learned a lot of tips and tricks along the way, which I'd like to share with you. The [official guide](https://todoist.com/guide/getting-started?lang=en) describes the basics to get started, but I want to cover some more advanced or lesser-known features in this post.

**Update**: Todoist also published a [Hidden Features](https://doist.com/blog/hidden-features-todoist/) post, covering even more tips & tricks.

[Customize your start page](#customize-your-start-page)
-------------------------------------------------------

As of version 949, custom queries were removed. You will have to create a custom filter and select it instead.By default, Todoist uses the "Next 7 days" view. But it's also possible to [define](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000281429-Change-your-default-start-page) any project, filter or custom query as home page. Go to *"Settings"* → *"General"* and select *Custom query* as your *Start page*.

![](custom-start-page.png)

That's the query I'm using: `overdue, 3 days, @next, p:Inbox`. This will show the following sections by default:

* overdue
* next 3 days
* tasks marked with `@next` label
* the inbox (depends on your language, e.g. it's `p:Eingang` in German)

[Recurring tasks based on completion date](#recurring-tasks-based-on-completion-date)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Todoist offers many ways to create [recurring tasks](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000636289-Set-a-recurring-due-date) using the `every` keyword. One overlooked feature is adding **!** to **every**. Here's the difference:

* `every month` creates tasks based on the task's original date. This is useful for tasks with exact due dates, e.g. *paying your rent*.
* `every! month` creates tasks based on the task's last completion date. This is more appropriate for tasks that must be completed at regular intervals, e.g. *working out*.

Let's say we create a recurring task on January 10 and complete it on January 15. When `every` is used, the next occurrence is February 10, while `every!` leads to February 15:

[Postponing recurring tasks](#postponing-recurring-tasks)
---------------------------------------------------------

In a perfect world we would always complete our scheduled tasks on time. But sometimes you can't or don't want to finish a task today. There are various ways to deal with this:

* Leave the task as **overdue** and finish it later. This may not be the best solution for passionate procrastinators, though. This also reduces your Karma points if you leave a task overdue for more than 4 days.
* Mark the task as **completed**. However, this will distort your Karma points (as you check off a task that you did not actually complete).
* By **editing the date field** or using [smart date recognition](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205989121-Enable-disable-smart-date-recognition) you are able to re-define the task's schedule. This is not the preferred way to reschedule tasks, but it's possible using the `starting` keyword, e.g. `every day starting tomorrow`
* Much more convenient is the built-in postponing mechanism. Open the task's menu and click on the circle arrow to **reschedule** the task to its next due date. This will not alter your task's original date query.

[Structure subtasks](#structure-subtasks)
-----------------------------------------

[Subtasks](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/206432369-How-to-create-sub-tasks-) are handy to structure your tasks within a project. Let's improve the hierarchy visually by connecting the following features:

* A task starting with `*` (followed by a *space*) will hide its checkbox. This makes it perfect for subheadings.
* Todoist supports basic [Markdown](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195102-Text-Formatting-) formatting, so surround a text with `**Text**` to make it appear bold.

When combined, we are able to create a "Scheduled" project with `* **Monthly**`, `* **Weekly**` and `* **Daily**` sections:

![](subtasks.png)

This makes it easier to distinguish parent projects from subprojects.

[Archive subtasks](#archive-subtasks)
-------------------------------------

Completed tasks are archived automatically. However, this does not apply to *subtasks* by default. Instead, checking off a subtask marks it as completed without removing it from the view:

![](completed-subtasks.png)

This may make sense for some people, but I don't like seeing completed tasks on my todo list. You can select the task's menu and click `Archive`, but there is an easier way to achieve it: Hold down `Shift` on your keyboard while checking off a subtask to automatically archive it.

[Expand / Collapse all tasks](#expand-collapse-all-tasks)
---------------------------------------------------------

Subtasks are not only useful to structure your tasks. They also allow you to hide/collapse all children tasks by clicking the black arrow.

It would be great to collapse/fold or expand all subtasks at once, especially when dealing with many tasks. Unfortunately, Todoist does not offer such a feature, but it's possible with *Bookmarklets*, small scripts stored as browser bookmarks.

Drag and drop these links onto your bookmark bar and click them while your Todoist web app is open:

[Projects comments (premium)](#projects-comments-premium)
---------------------------------------------------------

You might have been using [task comments](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205348311-Comments-File-Uploads) already: hover over a task and click the speech bubble that appears next to the task name.

But did you know that you may also attach comments to *projects*? It's quite useful for generic notes or discussions.

[Backup your data](#backup-your-data)
-------------------------------------

I manage most of my tasks in Todoist, and I'd hate losing any of them. If you're a Premium user, Todoist already creates [automatic backups](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001799989) for all your active tasks. You can also try my [Export tool for Todoist](https://darekkay.com/todoist-export/) — an app I wrote several years ago. It's free, open source and doesn't require a premium account. It also allows you to download all your data, including account information and archived tasks (JSON only).

[Conclusion](#conclusion)
-------------------------

Todoist is a simple yet powerful task manager. I hope my post helps you to get even more out of this app. If you're looking for more tips, visit the (unofficial) [Todoist subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/), where people share a lot of useful knowledge.
