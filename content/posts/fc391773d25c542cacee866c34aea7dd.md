Overview
--------


> âTo be a good designer you must be a good engineer in every sense: curious, inquisitive.â  
> â Charles Eames, 1949

Becoming a great designer is about much more than taking a single course or attending a single bootcamp.

You have to be self-sufficient. You have to be hungry to learn.

Throughout design school I collected every resource I found to be useful. Since then I have continued to amass a collection of links, books, articles, and more that will help you speed boost your career.
