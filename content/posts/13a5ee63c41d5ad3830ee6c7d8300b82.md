### Fixed:


* No longer missing tasks which have queued as the same key (e.g., for the same operation to the same file).

	+ This may fixes some more issues. I will reply in a few days!
* Some trivial issues have been fixed.

* Reloading Obsidian can be scheduled until that file and database operations are stable.

064.2.57.0[Digital Garden](/plugins/digitalgarden)favoriteshare5 days ago by Ole Eskild SteensenChangelogMultiple files in one commit 🎉
==============================


This release implements the most requested feature so far: putting multiple files in one commit. This means that publishing many files at once, will only trigger one deploy in Vercel/Netlify/etc. 



At most, the plugin will do two commits, one for changed/new files and another one for deleted files. 

Additionally the performance of publishing has increased dramatically, as the file upload are now done in parallel.

Updates from Excalidraw.com
---------------------------


* Improved undo management.
* Improved handle to scale images from the side.
* Changed arrow binding behavior.
* Many other minor fixes and improvements.


New
---


* Introduced image caching for nested (embedded) Excalidraw drawings on the scene. This enhancement should lead to improved scene loading times, especially when dealing with numerous embedded Excalidraw drawings.
* Added new OCR Command Palette actions. Users can now re-run OCR and run OCR for selected elements.


Fixed
-----


* Fixed an issue where cropping an embeddable PDF frame in the Excalidraw Scene caused distortion based on the embeddable element's aspect ratio. ([#1756](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1756))
* Removed the listing of `# Embedded files` section when adding a "Back of the note card". ([#1754](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1754))
* Resolved the issue where closing the on-screen keyboard with the keyboard hide button of your phone, instead of tapping somewhere else on the Excalidraw scene, did not resize the scene correctly. ([#1729](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1729))
* Fixed the problem where pasting a text element as text into markdown incorrectly pasted the text to the end of the MD note, with line breaks as rendered on screen in Excalidraw. Also addressed the issue where pasting an image element as an image resulted in it being pasted to the end of the document. ([#1749](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1749))
* Corrected the color inversion of embedded images when changing the theme from light to dark, then back from dark to light, and again from light to dark on the third change.
* Addressed the problem where cropping an image while unlocking and rotating it in the cropper did not reflect the rotation. Note that rotating the image in Cropper required switching to markdown view mode, changing the "locked": true property to false, then switching back to Excalidraw mode. This issue likely impacted only a very few power users. ([#1745](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1745))


New in ExcalidrawAutomate
-------------------------



```
/**
   * Retruns the embedded images in the scene recursively. If excalidrawFile is not provided, 
   * the function will use ea.targetView.file
   * @param excalidrawFile 
   * @returns TFile[] of all nested images and Excalidraw drawings recursively

103.10.0.0[Various Complements](/plugins/various-complements)favoriteshare8 days ago by tadashi-aikawaChangelog🎇 **Shiny New Things**
----------------------


### Fallback linkify #292


The [Fallback linkify](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/1.%20Features/Fallback%20linkify/) feature relaxes [Match strategy](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/5.%20Terms/%F0%9F%96%BC%EF%B8%8F%20Match%20strategy/) or suggests creating a new 'Internal link' when no appropriate candidates, particularly for 'Internal links', are found.


Imagine this scenario: you expected a note that had already been created to be suggested as a candidate for an internal link… However, the note did not actually exist, and no suggestions were displayed, disrupting our writing flow. This feature is designed for such situations, allowing the immediate linkification of words or phrases entered just before, without interrupting the writing process.


The fallback process varies depending on the 'Match strategy' setting. If the 'Match strategy' is set to `prefix`, the first command will fallback to `partial`, and the second command will revert the phrase/word and convert it into an internal link. When the 'Match strategy' is `partial`, it converts directly to an internal link on the first command.

* If no other candidates besides 'Internal link' are displayed, and if 'partial match fallback' does not yield results, then immediately proceed to 'new link fallback'
* The max number of suggestions provided by the 'new link fallback' matches the [⚙️ Max number of words as a phrase](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/4.%20Options/4.1.%20Main/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F%20Max%20number%20of%20words%20as%20a%20phrase/) setting.

112.2.4.0[ZettelFlow](/plugins/zettelflow)favoriteshare9 days ago by RafaelGBChangelogShinny New Things
-----------------


* #60 New action - manage tasks! automatic rollover with regex, recursive folder flags, initial folder, prefix and suffix.


Since I have a script with that feature with a solid use for months I decided to include it as another action.



```
const getAllUnfinishedTodos = async (file: TFile, tasksHeader: string) => {
  const contents = await FileService.getContent(file);
  const contentsForDailyTasks = contents.split(tasksHeader)[1] || contents;
  const unfinishedTodosRegex = /\t*- \[ \].*/g;
  const unfinishedTodos = Array.from(
    contentsForDailyTasks.matchAll(unfinishedTodosRegex)
  ).map(([todo]) => todo);
  const fileWithoutTasks = contents.split(/.*\t*- \[ \].*\n?/g).join("");
  await FileService.modify(file, fileWithoutTasks);
  new Notice(
    `Rollover ${unfinishedTodos.length} unfinished task/s from ${file.basename}`
  );
  return unfinishedTodos;
};
```

* Improved UI for step Builder modal
