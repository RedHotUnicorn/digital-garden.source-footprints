I'm not entirely opposed to a commercial product, but the list of documented limitations does not make me reach for my wallet just yet:1. Avoid using functions that return different values each time they are called, like random() and date('now')

2. AUTOINCREMENT keyword is not supported

3. We must use just a single connection to each database file. Do not let many apps access the same database file. Each instance must use its own db file, and then they will be replicated and synchronized using LiteSync

There are definitely obvious technical reasons for these, but it may make using the product for existing apps pretty much impossible.

Also worrisome is the lack, at least anywhere in the examples, of authentication parameters on the (proprietary, I guess?) TCP replication protocol, and no mention of over-the-wire encryption.
