===========================================

The great scientists and engineers who inspired us to create Lattics

![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvannevar_bush.d575194c.png&w=384&q=75)**Vannevar Bush**1890-1974As early as 1945, Vannevar Bush proposed a "Brain-like" personal knowledge management system in As We May Think, which he called Memex. It later inspired Personal Computer, Graphical Interface, Internet, and World Wide Web.

In this system, Engelbart proposed many advanced concepts including Mouse, Hypertext Link, Multi-window Interface, etc., which aimed to augment human intelligence.

In this book, he mainly discussed the mechanisms and principles of human cognition and thinking. He proposed a structure of chunks and serial lists of brain memory(Psychology of Thinking), also discusses the hierarchical properties of complex systems (The Architecture of Complexity). All of these provide a theoretical basis for the architecture of Lattics.
