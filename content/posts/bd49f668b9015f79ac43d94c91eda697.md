Janitor Plugin
==============


This plugin helps keeping the vault under control, by possibily removing the following resources.


Orphan files
------------


These are media or attachments that are not referenced anywhere. Janitor looks also in frontmatters (for example for `annotation-target` or similar)


Empty files
-----------


These are files either empty or consisting only of whitespace (newlines, tabs, and so on)


Big Files
---------


You can specify a limit size and Janitor will prompt you delete big files. Use it at your own risk. By default Janitor will prompt if about to delete a big file, even if the "ask confirmation" setting is disable.


Expired Notes
-------------


Janitor uses an approach similar to [Obsidian Expiring Notes](https://github.com/joerncodes/obsidian-expiring-notes) in which a (configurable) attribute is looked for in the frontmatter in order to set an expiration date to notes. For Example:



```
---
expires: 2022-09-01
---

```

Janitor also comes with utilities command used to easily set expiration date into notes.


Excluded Files
--------------


Janitor can exclude files that are excluded by Obsidian (Settings->Files & Linkds->Excluded files) but users can also specify different criterias for exclusions (for example based on file extension or path).


How to run
----------


Janitor could be set to run at startup. If "ask confirmation" is set, it will prompt the user with a confirmation dialog. User can select which files to delete and which action to perform (trash in Obsidian, trash in OS or delete permanently).


Janitor scan can also be launched from a ribbon button or from commands.
