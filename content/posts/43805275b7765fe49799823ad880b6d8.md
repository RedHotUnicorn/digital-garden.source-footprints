*This article is the first part in a series on modern data warehousing using data vault.*

Introduction
------------

The classic data warehouse architecture, going back to Bill Inmon, consists of three layers with different purposes:

* a **staging layer** for getting data from various source systems into the data warehouse,
* a **core layer** for integrating the data from the different systems and
* a **presentation layer** for making the data accessible to consumers.

In most cases, these layers are implemented as different schemas in the same database but there are hybrid setups as well (e.g., using a Hadoop system for the staging layer and an analytical database for the core and presentation layers).

Nowadays, the core layer is usually modeled using **data vault** constructs. Inmon himself has endorsed this approach as far back as 2007.

The presentation layer is usually modeled in a **dimensional** way. In recent years, new tools have made flat tables more popular.

Staging Layer
-------------

In the staging layer, data from operational systems and other sources is collected and prepared for loading into the core layer.

Historically, the staging layer only consisted of a **transient staging area** that contained tables that basically were 1:1 copies of source system tables. Each table was filled with the data from its source system counterpart and emptied after the data had arrived in the core layer.

In recent years, the staging layer’s responsibilities have expanded. Often, it includes a **persistent staging area** that acts as a permanent archive of source data deliveries. This allows for loading and historizing source data before you have explicitly modeled it and serves as a kind of insurance against modeling mistakes in the core layer. If you have to change the core layer model, you can easily repopulate it from the persistent staging area.

A persistent staging area can be implemented as a **history of changes** (similar to an SCD2 dimension, using source system primary keys and a technical, DWH-generated timeline) or as a **history of snapshots** (storing all deliveries as they come, like a data lake).

In addition, the proliferation of **non-tabular sources** that store data in JSON or XML formats (or at least only let you access the data via APIs that return them in such formats) means that the staging layer has to convert source data into a tabular format for easier downstream processing. As developing your own conversion routines can be challenging, you might want to use a third-party tool that does the conversion for you and only work with its tabular output yourself.

Core Layer
----------

In the core layer, the data from the different source systems is integrated, historized and transformed from the way the sources actually store it to the way the organization wants to see it.

To reliably fulfill these purposes, the core layer uses a normalized data model that splits the data into many different tables and therefore doesn’t offer the best user experience for analysts and other (usually human) consumers. Therefore, there is usually a presentation layer on top of it for user-friendly data access.

In recent years, data vault has become the most popular modeling paradigm for the core layer. Data vault splits the data into **hub**, **link** and **satellite** tables to create a flexible, easily extensible core layer with built-in historization that can be loaded with a small number of standardized loading patterns.

In many cases, the data vault model consists of a **raw vault** area that integrates the source data around business concepts and historizes attribute values using a technical, DWH-generated timeline but doesn’t correct, harmonize or otherwise calculate attribute values. Corrections, harmonizations and other calculations (also called “soft rules”) take place in a **business vault** area that takes data from the raw vault and makes it fit for presentation in case it isn’t.

While the raw vault usually consists of physical tables, the business vault often is partially or completely virtual (i. e., implemented as views) to allow for frequent changes to business rules and avoid unnecessary duplication of data.

Presentation Layer
------------------

In the presentation layer, the integrated data from the core layer is structured in a way that is accessible to consumers. These consumers can include human analysts, managers and other business users but also downstream systems that want to work with good-quality data.

Traditionally, the presentation layer consists of **data marts** that present the data for a certain subject area in the form of a dimensional model (**fact** tables surrounded by **dimension** tables). Sometimes, a distinction is made between **raw marts** (that present unrefined data from the raw vault in a dimensional format, e. g. for prototyping purposes) and **information marts** (that only present data that has been cleansed and harmonized).

Today, dimensional data marts are still the backbone of the presentation layer because they are familiar to users and their favorite BI tools alike. However, newer data visualization or data science tools might prefer their data flattened into one big table.

In addition to data marts, the presentation layer can include **data interfaces** that make data available to downstream systems in the format they need it (often flattened or even non-tabular). These systems can include websites, regulatory reporting, accounting or feedback loops feeding corrections or calculated values back to the source systems.
