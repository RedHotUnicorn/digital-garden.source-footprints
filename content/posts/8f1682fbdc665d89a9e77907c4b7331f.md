What is this?
-------------


Not everyone has the time to do a few hundred LeetCode questions. Here are *free and curated* technical interview preparation materials for busy engineers, brought to you by me, the author of [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). Over 500,000 people have benefitted from this handbook!


Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:


* [Best practice questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) for coding interviews
* [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) - the next evolution of Blind 75, bigger and better
* [How to prepare](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) for coding interviews
* [Coding interview best practices](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-cheatsheet/) - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts
* [Algorithm cheatsheets and tips](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) categorized by topic
* [Step-by-step Software Engineer resume guide](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/) to prepare a FAANG-ready resume
* [Behavioral questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions/) asked by the top tech companies
* [Front end interview preparation](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com)


Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!


Why would you read this?
------------------------


This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.


The information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don't want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.


Who is this for?
----------------


Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

 [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-coding-interview) by Design Gurus üí°

How is this repository different?
---------------------------------


There are many awesome books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.


Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. üòé

### [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-coding-interview)


This course by Design Gurus expands upon the questions on the recommended practice questions but approaches the practicing from a questions pattern perspective, which is an approach I also agree with for learning and have personally used to get better at coding interviews. The course allows you to practice selected questions in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!** [**Get lifetime access today ‚Üí**](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-coding-interview)

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.


Contributing
