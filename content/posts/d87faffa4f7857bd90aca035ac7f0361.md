Comment on and highlight what interests you.
--------------------------------------------


Annotate articles, websites, videos, documents, apps, and more – without clicking away or posting elsewhere. Hypothesis is easy to use and based on open web standards, so it works across the entire internet.

Turn annotations into conversations.
------------------------------------


Classrooms, coworkers, and communities can share ideas, ask questions, and respond to annotations. Set groups to public or private to create your ideal discussion.

Build durable, shared knowledge.

No more losing valuable knowledge across email, forums, and apps.  Annotations are saved at the source and accessible to everyone, preserving commentary in context.
