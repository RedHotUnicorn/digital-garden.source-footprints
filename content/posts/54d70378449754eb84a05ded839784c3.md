**GitAhead** is a graphical Git client for Windows, Linux
 and macOS. It features a fast native interface designed to help you
 understand and manage your source code history.
 



 GitAhead was designed by [SciTools™](https://scitools.com),
 the makers of [Understand™](https://scitools.com/features/).
 It has all of the features you expect from a commercial quality client,
 now completely free and open source.
 



 Git provides a wealth of historical information that, too often, goes
 unexploited because it's cumbersome to explore with other tools. We
 believe that when you understand your history you'll make better
 choices today!

##### Please Note!



 GitAhead is no longer under active development. Low-level maintenance and bug
 fix releases will be made as necessary for the forseeable future, but no new
 features or major changes are planned at this time.
