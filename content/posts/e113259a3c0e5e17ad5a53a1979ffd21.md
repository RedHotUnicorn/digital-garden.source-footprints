HAVING, a less understood SQL clause
====================================

05.08.2022 â€” 2 min read

Understanding how the `group by` and `having` clauses work can help us write more efficient sql. I want to demonstrate this with an example based on a real situation.

Let's assume we have two tables - a country table with a country code and name, and an invoice table with an invoice number, country code, year, month, item count, and amount.


```
1select * from country;
```

> | ctry\_code | ctry\_name |
> | --- | --- |
> | US | USA |
> | CA | Canada |
> | CN | China |
> | .. | .. |
> 
> *7 rows*

  

```
1select * from invoice;
```

> | invoice\_nbr | ctry\_cd | year\_nbr | month\_nbr | item\_cnt | invoice\_amt |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | 2014001 | BR | 2014 | 3 | 13 | 162875 |
> | 2021172 | CA | 2021 | 10 | 200 | 1299355 |
> | 2020435 | CN | 2020 | 1 | 12 | 145654 |
> | 2016201 | US | 2016 | 8 | 900 | 7125125 |
> | 2021662 | US | 2021 | 4 | 100 | 800135 |
> | 2018743 | MX | 2018 | 11 | 5 | 76124 |
> | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. |
> 
> *4 million rows*

We want to write a sql that aggregates the invoice data 

* for each country and year, for all countries other than USA
* for each country, for all countries other than USA
* for each year (including data for USA)
* a grand total (including data for USA)

This is the output we want from our query:


> | ctry\_name | year\_nbr | tot\_cnt | tot\_amt |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Canada | 2014 | 200 | 1300000 |
> | Canada | 2015 | 220 | 1500000 |
> | Brazil | 2014 | 200 | 1150000 |
> | Brazil | 2015 | 180 | 1000000 |
> | Brazil | 2018 | 150 | 750000 |
> | .. | .. | .. | .. |
> | Canada | null | 420 | 2800000 |
> | Brazil | null | 530 | 2900000 |
> | .. | .. | .. | .. |
> | All countries | 2014 | 900 | 6406325 |
> | All countries | 2015 | 1000 | 7306368 |
> | All countries | 2018 | 1200 | 8206334 |
> | .. | .. | .. | .. |
> | All countries | null | 6124 | 41261346 |

Here's one that gives us the expected results. It uses 6 sqls for year-wise totals for each of the 6 countries (other than USA), 6 sqls for country-wise totals for all years, one sql for year-wise totals for all countries, and finally one sql for the grand total. These 14 sqls are then combined with 13 `UNION` operations as shown below.


```
1-- country, year totals2select c.ctry_name, i.year_nbr,3       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,4       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt5  from country c6 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)7 where c.ctry_name = 'Mexico'8 group by c.ctry_name, i.year_nbr  -- grouping by country and year9UNION10....11.... -- unions for each of the 6 countries excluding USA12UNION13-- country totals14select c.ctry_name, null as year_nbr,15       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,16       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt17  from country c18 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)19 where c.ctry_name = 'Mexico'20 group by c.ctry_name  -- grouping by just country21UNION22....23.... -- unions for each of the 6 countries excluding USA24UNION25-- totals for all countries by year26select 'All countries' as ctry_name, i.year_nbr,27       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,28       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt29  from country c30 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)31 group by i.year_nbr  -- grouping by just year for all countries32UNION33-- totals for all countries and all years34select 'All countries' as ctry_name, null as year_nbr,35       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,36       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt37  from country c38 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)
```
This query returns the expected results, but apart from being difficult to maintain, it is also slow and inefficient. It fetches data from the invoice table 14 times to perform 14 aggregations followed by an expensive set of `UNION` operations.

We can write a simpler and more efficient query with a better understanding of the capabilities of `group by` and `having`. Just as a `where` clause allows us to filter raw data, `having` lets us filter the resultset from a `group by` operation. The following sql uses `group by cube()` to generate aggregates for all combinations of country and year while filtering out the summary rows for USA with `having`.


```
1select coalesce(c.ctry_name,'All countries') as ctry_name,2       i.year_nbr,3       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,4       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt5  from country c6 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)7 group by cube(c.ctry_name, i.year_nbr)8having coalesce(c.ctry_name,'x') != 'USA'  -- exclude USA summary rows
```
What is this query doing? It uses `cube` with `group by` to get-

* one row for each country, year combination
* one row for each country (including data for all years)
* one row for each year (including data for all countries)
* one row for all years, all countries

It then excludes the rows where the ctry\_name is USA using the `having` clause. This query fetches data from the invoice table only once and is significantly faster then the initial sql.

Note that country-wise summary rows will have a `null` year. Similarly, year-wise summary rows will have a `null` country name, which we convert to `All countries` using the `coalesce` function. We also use `coalesce` in the `having` clause so we don't drop summary rows where the country name is `null`.

In this specific example, we needed to exclude data for USA in only two of the four aggregate groups. If the requirement was to exclude data for USA in all the summary rows, we would use the `where` clause to filter USA data before any aggregation occurs, rather than doing it in the `having` clause. The following query meets these requirements.


```
1select coalesce(c.ctry_name,'All countries') as ctry_name,2       i.year_nbr,3       sum(i.item_cnt) as tot_cnt,4       sum(i.invoice_amt) as tot_amt5  from country c6 inner join invoice i on (i.ctry_code = c.ctry_code)7 where c.ctry_name != 'USA' -- exclude USA in all summaries8 group by cube(c.ctry_name, i.year_nbr)
```
 `group by` supports extensions like `cube`, `rollup` and others that are extremely useful and are worth spending the time to understand better. We will take a look at `group by` in more detail soon.

*The actual sql this example is based on had 24 small queries that were combined with `union` and had more than two tables joined in each query. The rewritten sql was just 10 lines long compared to over 200 lines for the original code and ran in a few seconds compared to over half an hour for the original query.*
