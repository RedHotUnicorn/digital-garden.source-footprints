"Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time writing a review when I should really just be pointing at a game and demanding that people play it. This is one of those times. Steve Jackson's Sorcery! is an absolutely marvellous fantasy storybook adventure. Lushly illustrated and expertly told, it should not be missed by anyone even remotely interested in the genre." -- Gamezebo  
  
"Letâ€™s not mince words here... Sorceryâ€™s unique blend of tabletop-like roleplaying (including an incredible combat system quite unlike anything Iâ€™ve seen before), and elaborate branching pathways with custom scripts preserving the feeling of Steve Jacksonâ€™s work make me now want toâ€¦ no, HAVE TO acquire an iOS device" - Just Press Start
