Poline
======



 "**poline**" is an enigmatic color palette generator, that harnesses the mystical witchcraft of polar coordinates. Its
 methodology, defying conventional color science, is steeped in the esoteric knowledge of the early 20th century. This
 magical technology defies explanation, drawing lines between anchors to produce visually striking and otherworldly
 palettes. It is an indispensable tool for the modern generative sorcerer, and a delight for the eye.
 




 The tome of "**Poline**" documentation is a comprehensive guide to the arcane arts of color generation, 
 you will gain an understanding of how this tool creates its mystical and captivating palettes through the following sections.
 




Terminology & Working Principles
--------------------------------



 The name "**Poline**" **/ˈpɔːlaɪn/** represents the essence of the library - **a polar line**. 
 The combination of these two words symbolizes the process of creating a palette by drawing lines between **anchor** points. 
 This unique moniker encapsulates the heart and soul of this micro-library written in TypeScript.
 


 In "**Poline**", **anchors** represent the points that the lines are drawn
 between.
 The number of **points** determines the number of colors generated between
 each pair of anchors. The more points, the more colors generated. The positions of these points are determined by
 **position functions**.
 




Summoning
---------



 The use of "**Poline**" begins with the invocation of its command, which can be performed with or without arguments.
 If called without, the tool will generate a mesmerizing palette featuring two randomly selected **anchors.**




 On the other hand, one can choose to provide their own **anchor** points, 
 represented as a list of **hsl** values, for a more personal touch. 
 The power to shape and mold the colors lies in your hands.
 



 To create a palette, "**Poline**" requires at least two anchor points, but the number of anchors you can provide is limitless.
 The key to remember is that the more anchors you provide, the more challenging it becomes to generate a harmonious color
 palette.
 




Points
------



 The magic of "**Poline**" is revealed through its technique 
 of drawing lines between anchor points. The richness of the palette is determined 
 by the number of **points**, with each connection producing a unique color.
 



 As shown in the illustration, increasing the number of **points** will yield an even greater array of colors.
 By default, four points are used, but this can easily be adjusted through the 'numPoints' property on your Poline
 instance, as demonstrated in the code example.
 



 The resulting palette is a product of points multiplied by the number of anchor pairs.
 It can be changed after initialization by setting the **numPoints** property on your "**Poline**" instance.
 


Steps


Anchors
-------



 At the heart of "**Poline**" lies the concept of **anchors**, the fixed points that serve as the foundation for the creation of
 color palettes. **Anchors** are represented as a **list of hsl** values, which consist of three components: **hue** [0…360],
 **saturation** [0…1], and **lightness** [0…1]. 
 



 The choice is yours, whether to provide your own anchor points during
 initialization or to allow "**Poline**" to generate a random selection for you by omitting the 'anchorColors' argument. The
 versatility of "**Poline**" extends beyond its initial setup, as you can also add anchors to your palette at any time using
 the '**addAnchorPoint**' method. This method accepts either a **color** as HSL array values or an array of **X, Y, Z** coordinates, 
 further expanding the possibilities of your color creation.
 




Updating Anchors
----------------



 With this feature, you have the power to fine-tune your palette and make adjustments as your creative vision
 evolves. So whether you are looking to make subtle changes or bold alterations, "**Poline**" is
 always ready to help you
 achieve your desired result.
 



 The ability to update existing anchors is made possible through the '**updateAnchorPoint**' method. 
 This method accepts the **reference to the anchor** you wish to modify and either a color in the form of **HSL** 
 representation or an **XYZ** position array.
 




Position Function
-----------------



 The **position function** in "**Poline**" plays a crucial role in determining the **distribution of colors between the anchors**.
 It works similar to easing functions and can be imported from the "**Poline**" module.
 



 A position function is a mathematical function that maps a value **between 0 and 1** to another value between 0 and 1.
 By definition the same position function for all axes "**Poline**" will draw a straight line between the anchors.
 The chosen function will determine the distribution of colors between the anchors.
 



 If none is provided, "**Poline**" will use the default function, which is a sinusoidal function.
 



 The following position functions are available and can be included by importing the **positionFunctions** object from the "**Poline**" module:
 

* linearPosition
* exponentialPosition
* quadraticPosition
* cubicPosition
* quarticPosition
* sinusoidalPosition **(default)**
* asinusoidalPosition
* arcPosition


Position Fn


Arcs
----



 By defining **different position functions for each axis**, you can control the distribution of colors along each axis 
 (**positionFunctionX**, **positionFunctionY**, **positionFunctionZ**). 
 This will draw different arcs and create a diverse range of color palettes.
 


Position fn X(Hue / Light)
Position fn Y(Hue / Light)
Position fn Z (Saturation)


Looping Palette
---------------



 By default, the palette is not a closed loop. This means that the last color generated is not the same as the first color.
 If you want the palette to be a closed loop, you can set the **closedLoop** argument to true.
 



 It is also possible to close the loop after the fact by setting **poline.closedLoop = true|false**.
 


Closed Loop


Hue Shifting
------------



 With the power of hue shifting, "**Poline**" provides yet another level of customization. 
 This feature allows you to **shift the hue** of the colors generated by a certain amount, giving you the ability to animate your
 palette or create similar color combinations with different hues."
 



 "**poline**" supports hue shifting. This means that the hue of the colors will be shifted by a certain amount.
 This can be useful if you want to animate the palette or generate a palette that looks similar to your current palette but using different hues.
 



 The amount is a int or float between -Infinity and Infinity. It will permanently shift the hue of all colors in the palette.
 




Closest Anchor
--------------



 In some situations, you might want to know which anchor is closest to a certain position or color.
 This method is used in the visualizer to select the closest anchor on click.
 



```
poline.getClosestAnchorPoint(
  {xyz: [x, y, null], maxDistance: .1}
)
```


 The **maxDistance** argument is optional and will return null if the closest anchor is further away
 than the maxDistance.
 



 Any of the **xyz** or **hsl** components can be null. If they are **null**, they will be ignored.
 




Color List
----------



 The '**poline**' instance returns all colors as an array of **hsl** arrays or alternatively as an array of **CSS** strings, either formatted in **HSL** or stretched to **OKlch** or **lch**.
 



```
poline.colors
poline.colorsCSS
poline.colorsCSSlch
poline.colorsCSSoklch
```




Colors as HSL





Remove Anchors
--------------



 To remove an anchor, you can use the **removeAnchorPoint** method. 
 It either takes an **anchor** reference or an **index** as an argument.
 




Invert lightness
----------------



 "**Poline**"'s default lightness setting places 0 in the center of the circle and 1 at its edges. However, you have the option
 to invert the lightness, flipping the scheme so that 0 resides at the edges and 1 at the center.
 



 Like the turning of night into day, or the unfolding of a magical spell, "**Poline**"'s inverted lightness feature imbues your
 palettes with a mystical quality that will unleash your inner wizard. 
 


Invert Lightness


Color Model
-----------



 To keep the library as lightweight as possible, "**poline**" only supports the **hsl** color model out of the box.
 However, it is easily possible to use other color models by using a library like [culori](https://culorijs.org/api/). 
 


Current Model


Installation
------------



 "**poline**" is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poline). 
 Alternatively you can clone it on [GitHub](https://github.com/meodai/poline).
 



```
npm install poline
```


 You can also use the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/poline) to include the library in your project.
 



 I recommend using the **mjs** version of the library. This will allow you to use the **import** syntax.
 But you can also use the **umd** version if you prefer to use the **script** tag.
 



```
import { 
  Poline 
} from 'https://unpkg.com/poline?module'
```
