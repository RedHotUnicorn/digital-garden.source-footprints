Learn how to take great notes
=============================


> This is the no-frills guide to note-taking. It can be learnt in about thirty minutes.

Creating a habit of daily note-taking can improve everything from our mental health, to our productivity, to our thinking. However, it can be difficult to know where to start.

We’ve created this guide to help you. We’ve also created a note-taking app called [Reflect](https://reflect.app), but you should find this guide useful whether or not you use that.

You can also [subscribe](https://reflectnotes.beehiiv.com/) to get weekly note-taking workflows in your inbox.
