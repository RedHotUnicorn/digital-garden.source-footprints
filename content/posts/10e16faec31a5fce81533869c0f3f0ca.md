New maintainer for the Obsidian plugin docs
===========================================

I’ve donated the unofficial plugin documentation to the Obsidian team.

[Plugins](/tags/plugins/)I wrote the unofficial plugin docs for Obsidian when I was learning how to build a plugin myself. Eventually the plugin docs became a whole project of its own.

I’m thrilled to tell you that **the Obsidian team has accepted the plugin docs as the official developer documentation**. As such, I’m no longer maintaining the docs. You can find the new plugin documentation over at the
[Obsidian Developer Docs](https://docs.obsidian.md/Home?ref=marcusolsson.dev).

For the official announcement on the Obsidian blog, see
[New developer documentation site](https://obsidian.md/blog/new-documentation-site/?ref=marcusolsson.dev).

Thank you for all your support and contributions!
