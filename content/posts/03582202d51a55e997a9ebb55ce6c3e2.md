 Hi, my name is Andrea and I’m a mom to two beautiful kids. I’m also
 a teacher. I know what it’s like to learn a second language as well
 as a third language. I know the challenges that you face. Just
 remember:. When you’re learning a new language it’s OK to make
 mistakes. You really don’t have to worry. So there’s some things that
 you can do, for example, learn new words, phrases, idioms, and you can
 also do a lot of reading. And if you can find someone, to speak to,
 that will be great too. So just keep practising and good luck with
 your learning.

 Hi and welcome. My name is Tamar and I’m a native English speaker.
 I really admire and appreciate when others learn English as an
 additional language because frankly, learning another language
 can be quite challenging. Each language has its own structure,
 words, sounds, and accents that can be very different from your
 own native tongue and so one thing I like to tell others who are
 learning English is that it takes time and tons of practice. As
 for myself, I love learning languages too and so, I’ve learned
 to speak Spanish over the last several years and I am currently
 learning Portuguese. Though it can be intimidating to speak to
 a native speaker of your target language, I’ve learned that you
 can’t be shy in reaching out to others and getting the help you
 need if you want to achieve your language-learning goals. As well,
 you have to find creative ways of practicing English if you want
 to improve. For example, some of the creative ways I continue to
 practice and maintain my level in Spanish includes watching
 Spanish movies and T.V. shows on Netflix, reading books in Spanish,
 talking to myself in Spanish (yes, you heard right), and speaking
 with other native Spanish speakers whether online or in person.
 I intend to do the same with Portuguese. So, whatever level you’re
 at in your English-learning journey, take-heart. Learning English
 is a process, but don’t give up. I wish you the best!

 Hi everyone. My name is Sean and I'm 30 years old. I'm from
 Ireland, and my first language is English. Although, I do speak
 a second language, so I understand that sometimes it can be
 difficult. I find that the best thing to do is to watch films,
 read books, and listen to music in the language that I’m
 learning. You do not always understand everything, but sometimes
 understanding the context really helps you understand the content.
 I hope this helps. Thank you very much.

 Hello, my name is Elida and I’m an English teacher and writer.
 I love languages. It’s very exciting when you learn something new.
 I have a few suggestions to make your life easier. First, you
 should set your smartphone and your computer to the language you
 are learning. Then, if for instance you’re interested in technology
 you should start watching movies or series that are connected to
 technology. For example, programmers can watch “Mr Robot”, doctors
 and nurses can watch “Grey’s Anatomy” and lawyers can watch “Law
 and Order”. I myself am a big movie fan. Also, I think that you
 should read magazines, especially out loud because that helps a
 lot. If you have a dog or a cat or any pet I’m sure they will be
 happy to listen to you read. My dog always listens to me while
 I do online teaching. In the end don’t forget that the most
 important role of a language is for us to pass information. So,
 don’t worry if you make mistakes at the beginning – we’ve all
 been there. In time you’ll do much better. If you want to get
 in touch please do. I look forward to meeting you at English.best.

 Hello everyone, my name is Tim. I'm originally from the United
 States and I've spent the last 4 years teaching English as a
 second language in Thailand. In my free time I taught myself
 Thai because I knew it would be useful for me speaking with
 locals who couldn’t English themselves. When I first started
 learning Thai, I knew I had my work cut out for me because I
 struggled learning Spanish in high school. I really had a hard
 time with the thai language at first and can remember really
 being afraid of making mistakes and speaking with the locals.
 But I think this where we all do most of the learning through
 our mistakes. In fact, it may be nearly impossible to learn a
 language without exploring and discovering how it can and can’t
 be used. So my advice to all of you: is don’t be afraid to mess
 up, to misspeak, to be misunderstood and this is just part of
 the long process of mastering a language and as IT professionals
 take advantage of the opportunities that you have, to practice
 your English and do the activities that make learning languages
 enjoyable to you, whatever pursuit your interests and learning
 style. So I wish you all success in your language Learning and
 good luck.
