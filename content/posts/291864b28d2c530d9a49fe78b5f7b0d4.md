**Dear friends of Dear Data,****We're incredibly happy to say we've received so many messages from enthusiasts people of different ages and backgrounds who are drawing their data.****This section is for you.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Are you or your students already drawing your data?**  
[Email us](mailto:deardatapostbox@gmail.com)! We will be opening a gallery shortly to showcase all of your artwork.   


However, we will only accept artwork where your and your pen pal's home addresses are blurred/covered (and surnames / full names blurred for children, as per your school's or their parents' preference), as we would prefer to keep your details private.
2. **Are you a teacher and interested in using the Dear Data format with your students?**

Subscribe to [this mailing group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/teachingdeardata) and introduce yourself. You will be able to share your experience, learn from others and find data pen pals for your students.
3. **Are you looking for a data penpal?**

Subscribe to [this group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/drawingyourdata) and introduce yourself.

**We believe there is a huge potential to use this method to inspire students and non-data experts to start working with data, or as a simple way to meet a new friend while also connecting with yourself at a deeper level.**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All we kindly ask is that you to keep us posted (haha) on how your experiments are going! Please send us scans or pictures of your (or your students) postcards for our research and for our records! We'd love to share your data artwork with the world (so long as you give us permission).

### **All our best and thanks for your support in Dear Data,****Giorgia and Stefanie**
