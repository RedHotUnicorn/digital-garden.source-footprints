 Write Tangentially
==================

 Tangent is designed to let you write the way you think.
 Your thoughts are connected;
 Tangent lets you link to existing notes and make new ones with ease.

 Let your mind wander along the path of interest.
 Don't suppress thoughts, embrace them.

 Explore With Confidence
=======================

 Tangent visualizes the path of your thoughts with elegant sliding panels
 and a branching map that builds itself as you write. You always know where you are and where you've been.

 ![](/map.png) Follow the thread of your thoughts in any direction they take you. Never get lost.

 Own Your Own Thoughts
=====================

 Tangent works with local files directly on your device.
 Notes are stored as markdown files. They can be read or written to by any text editor.

 Nothing is hidden from you. Everything is yours.

 Free Forever
