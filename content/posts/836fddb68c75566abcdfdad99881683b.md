I have data that looks like this 



```
(def a [{:firmAccount "MSFT" :Val 10  :PE 3 }  
        {:firmAccount "MSFT" :Val 15  :PE 4} 
        {:firmAccount "GOG" :Val 15 :PE 3} 
        {:firmAccount "YAH" :Val 8 :PE 1}])

```

I want to group by on :firmAccount and then SUM the :Val and :PE for each firm account and get something like 



```
 [{:firmAccount "MSFT" :Val 25 :PE 7}
  {:firmAccount "GOG" :Val 15 :PE 3}    
  {:FirmAccount "YAH" :Val 8 :PE 1}]

```

It is really a trivial thing and in SQL I would not even think twice but since I am learning clojure please bear with me
