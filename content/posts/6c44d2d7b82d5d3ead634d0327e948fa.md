Installation
============

The notion-enhancer works on MacOS, Linux and Windows. It can be used within the desktop app or the web client as a browser extension.

Due to system limitations, mobile clients are not and will never be supported.

Once you've installed the notion-enhancer, read the [Basic Usage](/getting-started/basic-usage/) page to get started with it.


> **Warning:** the new version of the notion-enhancer handles storing local configuration differently to previous versions. If you used notion-enhancer prior to v0.11.0, please delete the `.notion-enhancer` folder to prevent any issues that may arise.
> 
> It can be found within your home/user folder, e.g. `~` on macOS and Linux or `C:\Users\YourName` on Windows (enabling the "show hidden files" option in your file manager may be necessary).


> **Warning:** though it is possible to have both vanilla Notion and enhanced Notion apps installed at once, they may interfere with each other and it is recommended against. Instead, consider using the enhanced app and vanilla website (or vice versa).

Browser Extension
-----------------

Once installed, the browser extension should update automatically.

### Firefox →

Go to the [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notion-enhancer/) and click "Add to Firefox".

### Google Chrome,  Microsoft Edge →

Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-enhancer/dndcmiicjbkfcbpjincpefjkagflbbnl) and click "Add to Chrome".

notion-repackaged
-----------------

notion-repackaged provides installable executables containing both Notion and the notion-enhancer for all platforms. This is the recommended method of installation.

Installations via notion-repackaged will need to be manually updated with each new release of Notion and/or the notion-enhancer.


> **Warning:** SSO sign-in (e.g. Google or Apple) does not work with notion-repackaged. Instead, you will use the `Continue with email` sign-in option. You may then need to relaunch the app after you have signed in for the notion-enhancer to activate.

### Windows →

* Installer: [`.exe`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-Setup-2.0.18-1.exe)
* Portable build: [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1-win.zip)

### MacOS


> **Warning:** as this is a modified version of the Notion app, it is unsigned. It may be detected as malware or be unable to be opened. If this occurs, it can be fixed by following [Apple's official instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).

#### Intel-based Macs →

* x86\_64 installer: [`.dmg`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1.dmg)
* Portable x86\_64 build: [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1-mac.zip)

#### Apple Silicon (M1) Macs →

* arm64 installer: [`.dmg`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1-arm64.dmg)
* Portable arm64 build: [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1-arm64-mac.zip)

An extra step is required to run the M1 (arm64) build of the app due to a bug in the packager we depend on (see [electron-userland/electron-builder#5850](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/5850)).

Open the terminal, type the following command, and then press the `return` key:


```
xattr -cr "<installation location>.app"

```

> The `<installation location>` should be replaced with the file path to where the app has been installed, e.g. `/Applications/Notion Enhanced`.


> If this is too complicated, it is recommended to use the notion-enhancer in the browser or run the Intel build of notion-repackaged through Rosetta instead.

### Linux

Both `vanilla` and `enhanced` variants are available for Linux, as there is no official vanilla Notion app for Linux-based operating systems.

There are a number of installation methods available depending on the distribution you are using. For a portable, distribution-agnostic build, try one of the below:

* x86\_64 build (vanilla): [`.AppImage`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-2.0.18-1.AppImage), [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-2.0.18-1.zip)
* x86\_64 build (enhanced): [`.AppImage`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1.AppImage), [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced-2.0.18-1.zip)
* arm64 build (vanilla): [`.AppImage`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-2.0.18-1-arm64.AppImage), [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-2.0.18-1-arm64.zip)
* arm64 build (enhanced): [`.AppImage`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/Notion-Enhanced-2.0.18-1-arm64.AppImage), [`.zip`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced-2.0.18-1-arm64.zip)

#### Debian,  Ubuntu,  Pop!\_OS,  Linux Mint →

To add notion-repackaged to your package manager:


```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/notion-repackaged/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/notion-repackaged.list
sudo apt update

```
The app can then be installed via:


```
sudo apt install notion-app-enhanced
// or
sudo apt install notion-app

```
Otherwise, you can download the `.deb` and install it manually:

* arm64 build (vanilla): [`.deb`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app_2.0.18-1_arm64.deb)
* arm64 build (enhanced): [`.deb`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced_2.0.18-1_arm64.deb)
* amd64 build (vanilla): [`.deb`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app_2.0.18-1_amd64.deb)
* amd64 build (enhanced): [`.deb`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced_2.0.18-1_amd64.deb)


```
sudo dpkg -i <downloaded file>.deb

```
#### Fedora →

Add notion-repackaged to your package manager by creating the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/notion-repackaged.repo` with the following contents:


```
[notion-repackaged]
name=notion-repackaged
baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/notion-repackaged/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

```
The app can then be installed via:


```
sudo dnf install notion-app-enhanced
// or
sudo dnf install notion-app

```

> `yum` may be used instead of `dnf`.

Otherwise, you can download the `.rpm` and install it manually:

* x86\_64 build (vanilla): [`.rpm`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-2.0.18-1.x86_64.rpm)
* x86\_64 build (enhanced): [`.rpm`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced-2.0.18-1.x86_64.rpm)
* aarch64 build (vanilla): [`.rpm`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-2.0.18-1.aarch64.rpm)

```
sudo rpm -i <downloaded file>.rpm

```
#### Arch Linux,  Manjaro →

The app can be installed from the AUR using an AUR helper (e.g. `yay`):

Otherwise, you can download the `.pacman` and install it manually:

* x86\_64 build (vanilla): [`.pacman`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-2.0.18-1.pacman)
* x86\_64 build (enhanced): [`.pacman`](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/releases/download/v2.0.18-1/notion-app-enhanced-2.0.18-1.pacman)

```
sudo pacman -U <downloaded file>.pacman

```
Manual Enhancement
------------------

If you would prefer to apply the notion-enhancer to an existing vanilla installation of Notion, you can use the [notion-enhancer/desktop](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/desktop) package directly.

Manual command-line installations will need to be re-applied with each new release of Notion and/or the notion-enhancer.


> This is not available on Linux, but can be done through the Windows Subsystem for Linux in order to enhance the Windows app.


> **Warning:** the vanilla Notion app has recently updated to Electron 18 and will automatically update. The notion-enhancer is not yet compatible with this. As such, please stick to version 2.0.18 of the Notion app or use notion-repackaged until further notice.

#### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.0.0+
* A default installation of the [official Notion app](https://www.notion.so/desktop)

#### Enhancement →

If the `npx` package runner is available, the notion-enhancer can be inserted into Notion with a single command.


```
npx notion-enhancer apply

```
If it is not, refer to the steps below:

1. Open a command line and install the [notion-enhancer NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-enhancer):

 
```
npm i -g notion-enhancer
// or
yarn global add notion-enhancer

```
2. Insert the notion-enhancer into Notion:

 
```
notion-enhancer apply

```
3. If you are using MacOS and experience any errors related to file permissions or corrupted/broken apps, run the following and then re-attempt step #2:

 
```
sudo chmod -R a+wr /usr/local/lib/node_modules
sudo chmod -R a+wr /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod -R a+wr /Applications/Notion.app/Contents/Resources
xcode-select --install
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Notion.app

```
