Obsidian TodoTxt Plugin
=======================


Manage [\*.todotxt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) files in Obsidian.


[![](/mvgrimes/obsidian-todotxt-plugin/raw/main/docs/screenshot.png)](/mvgrimes/obsidian-todotxt-plugin/blob/main/docs/screenshot.png)


Install the plugin and put your todo file in your Obsidian vault with the
`.todotxt` extension (ie, `TODO.todotxt`).


Creating a `.todotxt` file from within Obsidian can be a bit tricky. When you
create a new note Obsidian will automatically append the `.md` extension, so
`TODO.todotxt` becomes `TODO.todotxt.md`. To fix this, you can right-click on
the file in Obsidian sidebar, select Reveal in Finder/File Explorer, and then
change the file extension to `.todotxt`. If you are successful, the file will
be listed in the Obsidian sidebar followed by a `TODOTXT` badge.


Additional Features
-------------------


The TodoTxt Plugin supports some extensions to the basic todo.txt spec:


### Due Dates


Due dates can be specified by including `due:yyyy-mm-dd` in the text of the
task item. The plugin will highlight the due date and shift to orange as the
date nears then red when the due date is missed. The date must be specified in
the `yyyy-mm-dd` format (including padding the month or day with a `0` if
needed) and no whitespace may be included.


### Preserving Priorities on Complete


EXPERIMENATL: This feature is experimental and needs to be enabled in the settings.


As described in the todo.txt [spec](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt),
priorities are typically discarded when a task is marked as complete. This
extension to the spec will preserve the priority in a `pri:X` tag. It will also
restore the priority if the task is later marked as uncompleted.


### Recurring Tasks


EXPERIMENATL: This feature is experimental and needs to be enabled in the settings.
This is not part of the todo.txt [spec](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).


Recurring tasks can be specified by including the `rec:` tag. When such a task
is marked as complete a new task will created with a `due:` tag based on the
value in the `rec:` tag.


See further documentation of [recurring tasks](/mvgrimes/obsidian-todotxt-plugin/blob/main/docs/RECURRING.md).


### Threshhold Dates


Threshold dates are indicated by the `t:YYYY-MM-DD` tag. Tasks with a specified
threshold are not considered ready to be undertaken until the threshold date.
The Todotxt Plugin will display tasks with threshold dates in the future with a
subtlely muted text.


How to Install by Hand
----------------------


1. Clone this repo.
2. `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. `yarn run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.


Manually Installing the Plugin
------------------------------


Copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault
`VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/todotxt-plugin/`.



```
cp dist/* VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/todotxt-plugin/

```

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------


Use `tab` and `shift-tab` to navigate through your todos.


* `ctrl-n` to create a New todo task
* `ctrl-/` goto filter input
* `e` or `enter` to Edit the current todo task
* `d` to Delete the current todo task
* `space` toggle done


Future Development
------------------


Development
-----------


Helpful commands to run while developing:



```
yarn run dev # compile typescript to ./dist via esbuild
yarn run css # compile css to ./dist via postcss
yarn run cp # copy files from ./dist to Obsidian plugins dir
yarn run parser:watch # compile .peggy grammar to parser.js
yarn run test:watch # run tests in watch mode
```

We are using the moment package because Obsidian already requires it. Otherwise
would use something lighter weight (like date-fns) or built-in.


Thanks

* Thanks to the authors of [todotxt](https://github.com/todotxt).
* Thanks to the authors of [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com/) for documenting
the due and recurring extensions to the spec.


Support
-------


I've been asked if there are ways to support this plugin. I created it to
scratch my own itch and am just happy that others find it useful. Giving it a
star on github would be appreciated. If you are feeling extra generous, you can
buy me a coffee â˜•.
