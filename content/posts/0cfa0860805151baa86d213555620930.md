============================  
  
SOFA 4.0 UPDATES  
Sofa helps you be more intentional with your downtime by creating lists of things to watch, read, play, and more.  
  
With 4.0, you can add basically anything, and expand Sofa to fit your exact needs with Custom Categories, Ingredients, Smart Lists, and more.  
  
============================  
  
\*\*WHAT'S NEW\*\*  
ALL NEW HOME SCREEN DESIGN  
â€¢ New design for The Pile  
â€¢ New design, and name, for Logbook (formerly Activity)  
â€¢ New design, and name, for Pinned Items (formerly The Shelf)  
â€¢ Customize what is shown on the home screen and how "quirky" it is. Go to Settings â†’ Fiddly Things  
  
CUSTOM CATEGORIES  
Create categories for anything: articles, events, places to eat, and more.  
  
ADD YOUR OWN INGREDIENTS  
Create your own rating system, plan dates for future downtime activities, add robust tagging, and more.  
  
PINNED LISTS  
Always have certain lists within thumbs-reach.  
  
SMART LISTS  
Create lists that automatically populate based on a collection of filters.  
  
ADD MANUAL ITEMS  
You can now add items manually into Sofa with full editing capabilities. That means you can edit the title, description, image, and add your own Ingredients.  
  
ADD LINKS  
Paste links into Sofa and automatically get a nice preview along with pre-filled information.  
  
ADD VIA SHARE SHEET  
Add websites, videos, articles, and more into Sofa via the Share Sheet.  
  
USE IMAGES FROM CAMERA ROLL  
Use images from your camera roll or take a photo to use for cover images.  
  
============================  
  
\*\*BACKUP FILE CHANGES\*\*  
There is a new file format for Sofa backup files to work better with saving images and the new Ingredients feature. The new extension is .sofa3bk and will be automatically created starting from version 4.0.  
  
These new backup files will be a bit larger to account for the additional data that is now being saved.  
  
I've also added a setting for choosing the frequency of automatic backups: daily (default), weekly, every 2 weeks, and monthly.  
  
============================  
  
\*\*SHARED LISTS ARE ENDING\*\*  
Iâ€™m going to be ending the beta and removing the ability to create new shared lists.  
  
Shared Lists was launched as a beta feature in December of 2022. If you're not sure what "beta" means, it basically means that something is in an unproven or experimental state.  
  
During this time, I've learned a lot about what sharing looks like in Sofa, and what it doesn't. Basically, I need to go back to the drawing board and rethink how sharing will work in Sofa long-term.  
  
I have a lot of new things coming to Sofa that the current implementation of Shared Lists just doesnâ€™t work with. Things like Custom Categories, Ingredients, and more in the pipeline (i.e. Tracking Progress).  
  
Please know, I made this decision with care, and I'm genuinely sad that itâ€™s going away. That being said, itâ€™s something I want to bring back in the future.
