Create beautiful slide decks using an intuitive Markdown experience
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document.



The slides above are from generated directly from [Marp Core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core)

```
Based on CommonMark
-------------------

If you know how to write a document with Markdown, you already know how to write a Marp slide deck. Marp's format is based on [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a consistent Markdown specification. The only important difference is [a ruler `---` for splitting pages.](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown)

Directives and extended syntax
------------------------------

Sometimes simple text content isn't enough to emphasize your voice, so Marp supports a variety of [directives](https://marpit.marp.app/directives) and extended syntax ([image syntax](https://marpit.marp.app/image-syntax), [math typesetting](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#math-typesetting), [auto-scaling](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#auto-scaling-features), etc...) to create beautiful slides.

Built-in themes and CSS theming
-------------------------------

Export to HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint
-----------------------------------

Have you finished writing? It's time to share your deck! Marp can convert Markdown into presentation-ready HTML, PDF and PowerPoint files directly! (Powered by [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) / [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home))

Marp family: The official toolset
---------------------------------

The Marp ecosystem contains a rich toolset to assist your work. [**Marp for VS Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) is an extension that allows you to edit and preview slide Markdown and custom theming within VS Code. [**Marp CLI**](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/) is a command line tool allows you to convert Markdown with a simple CLI interface. [... and much more!](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/)

Pluggable architecture
----------------------

As a matter of fact, *Marp is essentially just a converter for Markdown.* The Marp ecosystem is built on [**the Marpit framework**](https://marpit.marp.app), a skinny framework for creating HTML/CSS slide decks. It has a pluggable architecture and any developer can [extend features via plugins](https://marpit.marp.app/usage?id=extend-marpit-by-plugins).

Fully open-source
-----------------

The Marp team loves open source! All tools and related libraries are built by [the Marp team](https://github.com/marp-team) and are MIT-licensed.

### Tools and integrations

[VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)[GitHub](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode)

![](/assets/marp-cli.png)The Marp CLI is the swiss army knife of the Marp ecosystem. Convert your Markdown into various formats, watch changes, launch server for on-demand conversion, and customize the core engine.

### For developers

All official Marp tooling uses this core as the engine. It is based on the Marpit framework and includes some extra features to help create beautiful slide decks.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marp-team/marp-core)[GitHub](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core)

Marpit (independented from Marp) is the framework that transforms Markdown and CSS themes to slide decks composed of HTML/CSS. It is optimized to output only the minimum set of assets required.
