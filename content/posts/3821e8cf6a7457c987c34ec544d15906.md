*Tp-Note* is a note-taking-tool and a template system - freely available for
Windows, MacOS and Linux - that consistently synchronizes the note’s meta-data
with its filename. *Tp-Note*'s main design goal is to convert some input text -
usually provided by the system's clipboard - into a Markdown note file with
a descriptive YAML header and a meaningful filename.
*Tp-Note* collects various information about its environment
and the clipboard and stores them in variables. New notes are created by
filling these variables in predefined and customizable *Tera*-templates.
*TP-Note's* default templates are written in Markdown and can be easily adapted
to any other markup language if needed. After creating a new note, *TP-Note*
launches the system's text editor and connects the default web browser to *Tp-
Note*'s internal Markdown/RestructuredText renderer and web server. The viewer
detects note file changes and updates the rendition accordingly.

Download installer packages and binaries
----------------------------------------


### Tp-Note Microsoft Windows installer package


* Installer package for Windows:


[tpnote-latest-x86\_64.msi](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/_downloads/wix/tpnote-latest-x86_64.msi)


As this early version of the Windows installer is not signed yet, Windows
will show the error message “Windows protected your PC”. As a work-around,
when you click on the link “More info”, a ”Run anyway” button will appear
allowing you to continue the installation process. In general, regardless
of where a program comes from, I recommend checking every installable
file with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).


### Tp-Note Debian/Ubuntu installer package


* Package compiled for Debian:


[x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debian/tpnote\_latest\_amd64.deb](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/_downloads/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debian/tpnote_latest_amd64.deb)

Tp-Note in official package repositories
----------------------------------------


### Tp-Note on NetBSD


* An official package is available on NetBSD and other "pkgsrc" supported
platforms.


To install Tp-Note on NetBSD, simply use the native package manager:



```
pkgin install tpnote
```


### Tp-Note on NixOS


* An official package is available on NixOS (as of 2024-03-16, only on the
unstable branch):



```
 environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.tpnote ]; 
```


### Get Tp-Note with the Nix package manager


* First install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download)
available for Linux, MacOS and Windows (WSL2).
Alternatively, for Linux there are also [prebuilt Deb/Pacman/Rpm
Nix installers](https://nix-community.github.io/nix-installers/)
available.


Once you have the Nix package manager installed on your system,
try out Tp-Note with:



```
nix-shell -p tpnote
```

or follow installation instructions here:
[NixOS packages - tpnote](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=tpnote&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=tpnote)


Other resources
---------------


* Copy the Unix man-page to `/usr/local/share/man/man1`:


	+ [tpnote.1.gz](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/_downloads/tpnote.1.gz)
* Copy Tp-Note's icon to `/usr/local/share/icons/`:


	+ [tpnote.svg](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/images/tpnote.svg)


Installation
============


Depending on the availability of installer packages for your operating
system, the installation process is more or less automated. For Windows
users the fully automated installation package [tpnote-latest-x86\_64.msi](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/_downloads/wix/tpnote-latest-x86_64.msi)
is available. For more information, please consult the [Distribution
section](#distribution) above and the [Installation section](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/tpnote--manual.html#installation) in
*Tp-Note*'s manual.


Upgrading
---------


While upgrading *Tp-Note*, new features may cause a change in *Tp-Notes*'s
configuration file structure:



```
*** ERROR:
Can not load or parse the (merged) configuration file(s):
---
invalid length 3, expected fewer elements in array in `viewer.served_mime_types`


Note: this error may occur after upgrading Tp-Note due to some incompatible
configuration file changes.

Tp-Note renames and thus disables the last sourced configuration file.

Additional technical details:
*    Command line parameters:
tpnote -b 
*    Sourced configuration files:
/home/joe/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml

```

The configuration file backup is stored in the same directory as the last
sourced configuration file, e.g. `/home/joe/.config/tpnote/`.
If Tp-Note sources more than one configuration file, consider the possibility
of syntax errors in any of these files (cf. [Customization section](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/tpnote--manpage.html#customization) of
Tp-Note\_'s man-page).


Building
========


If the above precompiled binaries do not suite you, you can
compile *Tp-Note* yourself.


1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), e.g.



```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

sudo apt install build-essential    
```

A modern Linux desktop usually ships the required shared
libraries. Here is a list extracted form a Debian binary:



```
ldd target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/tpnote 
     linux-vdso.so.1
     libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1
     librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1
     libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0
     libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6
     libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2
     libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
     /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```
2. Download, compile and install *Tp-Note*:


**Building on Linux**



```
cargo install tpnote
sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/tpnote /usr/local/bin
# Copy icon
sudo cp assets/tpnote.svg /usr/local/share/icons
```

Unlike previous Linux versions (<= 1.19.13), Tp-Note displays errors
and debug messages as notifications. This requires a Linux/BSD based
desktop environment that follows the XDG specification, e.g. KDE,
Gnome, XFCE, LXDC, Mate (and probably also most others).


The use of notifications also removes former GTK dependencies. Anyway,
if you prefer to see error messages on the console only, you can opt
out notifications and message boxes. In this case all error messages
are dumped on the console from where you started *Tp-Note* into
`stderr`:



```
cargo install --no-default-features \
  --features read-clipboard,viewer,renderer,lang-detection tp-note
sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/tpnote /usr/local/bin
```

**Recommended Linux console and server version**


The full-featured version of *Tp-Note* depends on GUI libraries like Xlib
which might not be available on a headless system. Either download the Musl
version [x86\_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/tpnote](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/_downloads/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/tpnote) or compile *Tp-Note*
yourself without default features:



```
cargo install --no-default-features --features renderer,lang-detection tp-note
sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/tpnote /usr/local/bin
```

If Tp-Note's binary size if of concern, omit the `lang-detection` feature
in the `cargo` invocation above. The `lang-detection` feature causes 95%
of the final binary size because of its extensive language models.


**Building on Windows and macOS**


Build the full-featured version with:



```
cargo install tpnote

```

When building for Windows or macOS, it does not make sense to exclude the
`message-box` feature, because - under Windows and macOS - it does not rely
on the notification library. Instead, it uses direct OS-API calls for
popping up alert boxes. As these calls have no footprint in binary size or
speed, always keep the `message-box` feature compiled in.


See also the user manual for a more detailed installation description.


Cross compilation
-----------------


Debian makes it easy to cross-compile for foreign architectures. Here are
some examples:


* Target Musl:



```
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
sudo apt install musl-tools

cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
```
* Target Raspberry Pi (32 bit):



```
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf

CARGO_TARGET_ARMV7_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNUEABIHF_LINKER=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc \
  cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --release
```
* Target Raspberry Pi (arm64, 64 bit):



```
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-arm64

CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \
 cargo build  --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```
* Target Windows:



```
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu  
sudo apt install binutils-mingw-w64 mingw-w64
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release 
```
