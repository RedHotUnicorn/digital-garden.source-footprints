SQL Indexing and Tuning e-Book
==============================



---

A site explaining SQL indexing to developers—no crap about administration.

SQL indexing is the most effective tuning method—yet it is often neglected during development. *Use The Index, Luke* explains SQL indexing from grounds up and doesn’t stop at ORM tools like Hibernate.

*Use The Index, Luke* is the free web-edition of [SQL Performance Explained](https://sql-performance-explained.com/?utm_source=use-the-index-luke.com&utm_campaign=front&utm_medium=web). If you like this site, consider getting the book. Also have a look at the [shop for other cool stuff that supports this site](/shop).

SQL Indexing in MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.
-----------------------------------------------

*Use The Index, Luke* presents indexing in a vendor agnostic fashion. Product specific notes are provided like here:

DB2*Use The Index, Luke* covers SQL indexing for IBM DB2. Tests were conducted with DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows, (LUW) V10.5 through 11.5.

MySQL*Use The Index, Luke* covers SQL indexing for MySQL. Tests were conducted with MySQL 5.5 through 8.0.34.

Oracle*Use The Index, Luke* covers SQL indexing for the Oracle database. Tests were conducted with Oracle 11g through 23ai.

PostgreSQL*Use The Index, Luke* covers SQL indexing for PostgreSQL. Tests were conducted with PostgreSQL 9.0 through 16.

SQL Server*Use The Index, Luke* covers SQL indexing for Microsoft SQL Server. Tests were conducted with SQL Server 2008R2 through 2022.

		2. *[Indexing SQL `LIKE` Filters](/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/like-performance-tuning)* — `LIKE` is not for full-text search
		3. *[Index Combine](/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/index-merge-performance)* — Why not using one index for every column?
	5. *[Partial Indexes](/sql/where-clause/partial-and-filtered-indexes)* — Indexing selected rows
	6. *[`NULL` in the Oracle Database](/sql/where-clause/null)* — An important curiosity
	
	
		1. *[`NULL` in Indexes](/sql/where-clause/null/index)* — Every index is a partial index
		2. *[`NOT NULL` Constraints](/sql/where-clause/null/not-null-constraint)* — affect index usage
