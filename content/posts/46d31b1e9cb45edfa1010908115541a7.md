Plus Minus Next - Weekly Reviews
================================

$0+$0+https://schema.org/InStockusd[![](https://public-files.gumroad.com/9n0rtti8kqeo8q87gr50air7yq2r)Ellane W](https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com/)4 ratingsThis template makes it easy to record a year’s worth of [Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) weekly reviews in a plain text app like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). 

Changes in this version: 

* Added a Monday version for the northern hemisphere (thanks to Kevin Geiss for changing the emojis around)
* Tip: use links or tags to identify Plus, Minus, or Next items in your interstitial journaling entries

If you find an error, please make sure you're looking at the most recent version, then email me or comment on this page to let me know.

The download consists of a series of files in a folder. Be aware this is *not* a complete Obsidian vault: it's designed to be copied into your existing vault.

You'll see that the weekly review page is essentially a simple list, as my approach is to stay away from app-specific plugins and features when a simple, more universal solution will do.

There’s a different icon next to each month, chosen to reflect the seasons of the southern hemisphere. You may like to change them to suit your tastes or part of the world, or just delete them.

The advantage of the emojis goes beyond looking pretty: in the outline pane it’s easy to see which week numbers belong to which month, and which weeks cross from one month to another.
