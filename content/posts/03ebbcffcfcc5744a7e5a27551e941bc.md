Rev Obsidian Sync
=================


Reverse engineered obsidian sync server (NOT OFFICIAL).


Warning

The main branch is the development branch. For stable usage, use the latest release.


Note

The plugin is broken on `obsidian >= 1.4.11`. This is intentional by the official ObsidianMD team. They have made clear their dissatisfaction with this project.
[The Path Forward](https://github.com/acheong08/obi-sync/issues/29) - We are in the early stages of designing an alternative plugin that does not make use of existing code by ObsidianMD team. It is still in the design phase and [help](https://github.com/acheong08/obi-sync-lib/issues/1) is needed. For now, we can manually patch the files from [https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/). I will write up a wiki page or automate that soon.

When you're done, install and configure the [plugin](https://github.com/acheong08/rev-obsidian-sync-plugin)


Adding a new user
-----------------


`go run cmd/signup/main.go`


Alternatively:



```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://yourdomain.com/user/signup \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"email": "example@example.com",
	"password": "example_password",
	"name": "Example User",
	"signup_key": "<SIGNUP_KEY>"
}'
```

You can set the signup key via the `SIGNUP_KEY` environment variable. If it has not been set, you can exclude it from the request.
