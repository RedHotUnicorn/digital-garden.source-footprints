![](/assets/images/readyforscience.png)![](/assets/images/readyforscience.png)Writing Formulas has Never Been Easier
--------------------------------------

Say goodbye to fidgety formula editors and antiquated syntax.

* `lim_(x->oo) 1/x = 0``Â`
* `vec(1, 2) dot.opvec(3, 4) = 11`

Arrow from code to rendered equation.* Formula: Limes from x to infinity of 1 over x equals 0.
* Formula: Dot product of vector 1,2 and vector 3,4 equals 11.
* Formula: A set of all real numbers x where x is natural and less than 10.
