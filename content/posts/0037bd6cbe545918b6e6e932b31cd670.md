Do you ever think about time? I mean, **your** time. The Notion life calendar displays in a grid all the weeks that make up a 90 years' life. The black squares are the weeks that have been passed already. The white squares, are the weeks yet to come.

I created this small life calendar to be embeddable in your digital life, so you can sometimes think about **your** time.

It should serve just as a semicolon in your daily life**;** a small pause.

Technically speaking, this digital calendar, cannot be cached **[[1]](#fn-1)**. Exactly as your life. Every time you will have a look at this image inside a Notion page, it will be a distinct and exact representation of the weeks you already lived, the weeks to come and, hopefully, it will remind you that time is a gift. And you can make great things with it.

The concept of a life calendar was invented by Tim Urban and, if you didn't already, check out his article [your life in weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). A really eye opening read.
