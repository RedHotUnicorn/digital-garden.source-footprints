Hi, I'm Tiago
-------------

I’ve spent more than 10 years researching and personally experimenting with a new way of organizing our digital lives.

What started as a quest to [survive a chronic illness](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-story-behind-basb/) turned into a **life-long mission to help people like you harness the full potential of their ideas and turn them into reality.** I firmly believe this is a crucial part of creating a better future for all of us. 

 ![Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Tiago_Forte_00014-1-1024x683.jpg)If you’re here reading this, then something in your life has caused you to stop and think, *“There must be a better way!”* (just like my chronic illness did for me). 

Maybe your responsibilities have increased dramatically as you started a family, a new job, or a business, and now you need a way to do great work, despite having less time. 

You might feel like you’re dropping balls left, right, and center, losing track of open threads, and it’s impacting those around you. 

Maybe you’re dissatisfied with your current job and want to move to a more fulfilling career and get more out of life. 

Or maybe you have a lot of ideas and expertise but don’t know how to link all that information together to make the impact you want to make. 

Whatever your situation, I can tell you that…

You Are Not Alone!
------------------

The constant feeling of overwhelm caused by waves of information washing over us is so common in our modern, hyper-connected world. 

Same for the feeling of never making tangible progress. Or the feeling of frustration when you can’t find something you were sure you saved. 

**I’ve encountered these feelings and challenges my entire life.** 

Yet, I’ve always known deep in my heart that there must be a better way to learn, solve problems, and do our best work. And that technology was the key, as long as we learned how to use it properly.

Over years of painstaking research and trial and error, **I found better ways of learning and working that allowed me to thrive.**

Now, my goal is to help you resolve these challenges for yourself without having to go through everything I did. To enable you to improve how you work to make it more fulfilling and impactful. To help you think more clearly about your productivity instead of accepting how it’s always been done. To see your work as an opportunity for personal growth and self-understanding instead of a burden.

**The quality of your work shapes the quality of your life, and I want to help you elevate both.**

How I Can Help You Reach Your Full Potential
--------------------------------------------

Over the last decade, **I’ve helped thousands of people build a Second Brain**.

It’s a trusted place outside your head where you can collect and organize your most important ideas and insights and use them to do your best work.

The ultimate goal of a Second Brain is to help you lead a more fulfilling life with more ease and less stress.

Sounds too good to be true? **Here’s what our students say about adopting the Second Brain system:**

 For YEARS I had searched for an outlet, some way to store, collate, manage, keep track of all of my thoughts, ideas, tabs (!), work and personal notes, and it was all-consuming and overwhelming. BASB was truly a godsend and a life changer for me. ![Rob Wilson](https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rob-Wilson.png) Rob WilsonFinancial services professional With a Second Brain, the chaos now lives in an external system. Which means my first brain is free of anxieties and is a much better place to be. My relationships with others (and myself) are better for it too. ![Ariane Santos](https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ariane-Santos.jpg) Ariane SantosServiceNow Architect Having a Second Brain has saved my behind. My parents passed away, and it has helped me immensely as the executor of their estates. I love this program and its amazing impact on my life. ![Scott Wilson](https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Scott-Wilson.jpg) Scott WilsonPast President Appraisal Institute of Canada I loved the Building a Second Brain course.

In the past, all I did was collect and lose information. Now I have a system! Data is not isolated anymore and everything connects.
