System Informer
===============


A **free**, powerful, multi-purpose tool that helps you **monitor system resources**, **debug software** and **detect malware**.

#### Graphs and statistics allow you quickly to track down resource hogs and runaway processes.


Use Ctrl+I to view system performance information.
 Move your cursor over a graph to get a tooltip with information about the data point under your cursor.
 You can double-click the graph to see information about the process at that data point, even if the process is no longer running.

#### Can't edit or delete a file? Discover which processes are using that file.


Use Ctrl+F to search for a handle or DLL.
 If all else fails, you can right-click an entry and close the handle associated with the file. However, this
 should only be used as a last resort and can lead to data loss and corruption.
