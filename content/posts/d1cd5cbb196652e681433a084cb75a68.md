Practically Paperless with Obsidian
===================================




Practically Paperless with Obsidian is a new blog series I am writing about going “practically paperless” (as in the practical sense” based on lessons learned from my Going Paperless experiment from nearly a decade ago. Rather than use Evernote, I have opted to use Obsidian for this experiment. For more information and rationale, see my post [Practically Paperless with Obsidian](https://jamierubin.net/2021/09/21/practically-paperless-with-obsidian/).
