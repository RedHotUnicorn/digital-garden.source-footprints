Hey Community


I’m interested in finding other people’s public digital gardens to see what’s on their mind and discover new information.


Is there a list for this? Especially in regards to data science and marketing/psychology and similar.


Thanks!

Ness Labs has a Telegram group about digital gardening, and links to people’s digital gardens pop up on r/DigitalGardens at Reddit.


Most blog posts on the subject have relatively few links with a lot of overlap between bloggers, but there are some more comprehensive lists on Github.


That last one on the list has a very helpful set of icons next to each one that lets you quickly ascertain the topic and current activity level of each project.
