Use Scrintal Now### Loved by visual thinkers everywhere

* Scrintal is more than just an app to us; it's a powerful tool that has transformed the way we work. It has brought us closer as a team, made us more efficient, and sparked creativity in ways we never thought possible.
* What I love (yes, not just "like") in Scrintal is the ability to have a bird's eye view of my notes. When I joined the PKM community I was looking for taking notes about my research, since I am a professional researcher.
* There's a reason we believe a picture is worth a thousand words – it is the unparalleled power of visual connections. Scrintal embodies this principle. It transcends traditional note-taking, offering an arena to not just capture thoughts but to weave them together.
* Scrintal allowed me to organise and unlock ideas in a way I couldn't with Obsidian or Miro. The wining aspect of Scrintal is the combination of top class note-taking, with bi-directional links, along with the ability to arrange those notes on a whiteboard or mind map.
* The more I use Scrintal, the more I like it. The best way I've found to get an abstract idea down to concrete points ready for action. From the abstract to the concreate without suffering... Each day less friction! Love it!
* Scrintal will be the next big thing, I can see it coming
* To summarize, Scrintal is (cliche alert!) a giant leap forward in productivity apps.

If you find the current crop of productivity apps lacking something, you may be another Scrintal user.
* I find that Scrintal has given me a sense of clarity, and added the visual component to be able to see the connections between my different notes (Cards). I also love the fact that they ask us users for ideas on how to develop Scrintal further, and actually listen to us!
* The fundamental design of Scrintal being a spatial canvas is such a game-changer to the note taking / productivity app market. Being able to quickly add notes and connect them like a networked mind map is so helpful to when I'm researching but also has a great use case creating content clusters in marketing.

Use Scrintal Now### Loved by visual thinkers everywhere

* Scrintal is more than just an app to us; it's a powerful tool that has transformed the way we work. It has brought us closer as a team, made us more efficient, and sparked creativity in ways we never thought possible.
* What I love (yes, not just "like") in Scrintal is the ability to have a bird's eye view of my notes. When I joined the PKM community I was looking for taking notes about my research, since I am a professional researcher.
* There's a reason we believe a picture is worth a thousand words – it is the unparalleled power of visual connections. Scrintal embodies this principle. It transcends traditional note-taking, offering an arena to not just capture thoughts but to weave them together.
* Scrintal allowed me to organise and unlock ideas in a way I couldn't with Obsidian or Miro. The wining aspect of Scrintal is the combination of top class note-taking, with bi-directional links, along with the ability to arrange those notes on a whiteboard or mind map.
* The more I use Scrintal, the more I like it. The best way I've found to get an abstract idea down to concrete points ready for action. From the abstract to the concreate without suffering... Each day less friction! Love it!
* Scrintal will be the next big thing, I can see it coming
* To summarize, Scrintal is (cliche alert!) a giant leap forward in productivity apps.

If you find the current crop of productivity apps lacking something, you may be another Scrintal user.
* I find that Scrintal has given me a sense of clarity, and added the visual component to be able to see the connections between my different notes (Cards). I also love the fact that they ask us users for ideas on how to develop Scrintal further, and actually listen to us!
* The fundamental design of Scrintal being a spatial canvas is such a game-changer to the note taking / productivity app market. Being able to quickly add notes and connect them like a networked mind map is so helpful to when I'm researching but also has a great use case creating content clusters in marketing.
