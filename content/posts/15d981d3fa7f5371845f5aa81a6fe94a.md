‚õ∞Ô∏è Graph Technology Landscape 2022 ‚õ∞Ô∏è
=====================================


This repository holds data about popular graph technologies in 2022. It imports them into Memgraph and creates cool visualization in Memgraph Lab.


üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run the app
----------------


To start the app run the following commands:



```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

```

After that, in [Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/download/#memgraph-lab), run the following query:



```
MATCH (n:Company)-[r:IS_PART_OF]->(s:Subcategory)-[b:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Category)
RETURN n,r,s,b,c;

```

üï¥Ô∏è Memgraph Lab Styling
-----------------------


To make this graph extra pretty in [Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab), copy the below styling:



```
@NodeStyle {
size: 30
border-width: 5
border-color: #ffffff
shadow-color: #bab8bb
shadow-size: 6
}

@NodeStyle HasLabel?(node, "Company") {
color: #FFC500
color-hover: Darker(#FFC500)
color-selected: #FFC500
image-url: Format("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memgraph/graph-landscape-2022/main/logo/{}.png", LowerCase(Property(node, "img")))
}

@NodeStyle HasLabel?(node, "Category") {
color: #ffd966
color-hover: Darker(#ffd966)
color-selected: #ffd966
}

@NodeStyle HasLabel?(node, "Subcategory") {
color: #ff9100
color-hover: Darker(#ff9100)
color-selected: #ff9100
}

@NodeStyle HasProperty?(node, "name") {
label: AsText(Property(node, "name"))
}

@EdgeStyle {
width: 1.5
}

```

Next, click on the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) to open the Style editor. After that, paste the above style to the editor and click on Apply. If you wish so, you can also save this style for future use.
