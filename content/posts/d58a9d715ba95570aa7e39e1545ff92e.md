 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=0)~~  Dataview is an Obsidian plugin I use every&nbsp;single day and it seriously helps my workflow. For those who don‚Äôt know Dataview is a&nbsp;plugin that allows you to create custom&nbsp;&nbsp; views that present data from all&nbsp;your notes in a lot of cool ways. The coolest part is that it doesn't&nbsp;matter much how you organize your notes. Just have a few pieces of data that&nbsp;describe what the content is about,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you can use that information to create custom&nbsp;visualizations showing what is important to you. In this video, I'll show you how I'm using&nbsp;this powerful plugin for an important task:&nbsp;&nbsp; managing all my knowledge sources but not with the&nbsp;goal of creating a second brain. A single one is&nbsp;&nbsp; hard enough to manage. All I want is something&nbsp;to help me better use the brain I already have. My thanks to Shortform for sponsoring this video. I remember that before creating this workflow&nbsp;I used to read a lot, listen to podcasts,&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=52)~~  watch hours and hours of educational videos. And I&nbsp;realized that even though I was consuming quality&nbsp;&nbsp; content, it was not bringing me many practical&nbsp;results because I was not reflecting or acting&nbsp;&nbsp; on any of it. But all of that changed when I&nbsp;started this habit of taking notes of the stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; that I consume and I'll show you exactly how I&nbsp;do it using Obsidian, with some nice plugins. So this is what I call the&nbsp;knowledge sources dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of my favorite pages in my&nbsp;Obsidian vault. It is the page where I&nbsp;&nbsp; centralize everything that I've consumed recently&nbsp;that has actually brought some value to my life. As you can see it consists of 3 different sections&nbsp;each containing a table. These tables are all&nbsp;&nbsp; generated by the Dataview plugin. I will quickly&nbsp;switch to edit mode so you can see. Each section&nbsp;&nbsp; is a block of code with the query that brings&nbsp;up the required fields in a specific order.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=103)~~  For those who don't have a programming background,&nbsp;this may seem a little daunting but don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the kind of thing you set up one&nbsp;time and don't need to change very often. The first section I call Internet Exploration.&nbsp;It serves to aggregate everything that comes&nbsp;&nbsp; from things I consume online like articles,&nbsp;newsletters, YouTube videos, and podcasts. I&nbsp;&nbsp; also created buttons to make it easier to add new&nbsp;items. I will explain in a moment how they work. Right below is the table of books, sorted with&nbsp;the most recent at the top. For the books,&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to display the covers and the nice thing is&nbsp;that I can click on the image to make it larger.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next are the titles where I can hover the mouse&nbsp;for a preview or click to open in a new panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you may have noticed I always start notes&nbsp;about a book using a B at the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp; the title to make it quicker to find. I can&nbsp;open the Quick Switch by pressing Command + O,&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=157)~~  and typing B hyphen to bring up only books&nbsp;in the results which I find extremely useful. And the third section on this page&nbsp;is for the courses that I take.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first field is the title, and here again,&nbsp;I use the same technique of using prefixes in&nbsp;&nbsp; the titles to make them easier to find. Every&nbsp;note that starts with a C I know is about some&nbsp;&nbsp; course or workshop I attended. Other fields are&nbsp;status that can be to do, in progress, or completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the related topics and&nbsp;finally the cost of each course. Here it is important to highlight the criteria&nbsp;for adding things to these tables or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only add things that brought me a lot of value&nbsp;and that I really want to do something with that&nbsp;&nbsp; information. I don't add everything, because&nbsp;that would defeat the purpose of this system. This one for example is my notes about this&nbsp;excellent article "Screw motivation, what you need&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=207)~~  is discipline" which was very useful for me some&nbsp;time ago. In this kind of note, I always try to&nbsp;&nbsp; be as succinct as possible capturing only the gist&nbsp;of the article and what really resonated with me. At the end of these notes, I usually put&nbsp;the metadata block. This is what allows the&nbsp;&nbsp; Dataview plugin to query and display the data&nbsp;as a table. For this type of note, I insert&nbsp;&nbsp; things like the type to distinguish between&nbsp;things from the internet, books, and courses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The media which in this case is an article&nbsp;but could be a video, newsletter, or podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's always good to keep the source link in case I&nbsp;want to share it with someone. The topics field is&nbsp;&nbsp; for linking related content. Each of them is&nbsp;in fact links to pages like in this example.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could use tags to classify each item but I&nbsp;realized that links are more useful because I can&nbsp;&nbsp; open the backlinks pane and navigate&nbsp;between multiple related contents. 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=259)~~  In the case of books, the fields are a little bit&nbsp;different. First, let me open an example. Besides&nbsp;&nbsp; the type, I add the author's name, date, and&nbsp;a rating field. Here I use the star emoji but&nbsp;&nbsp; to make it more practical I created a text&nbsp;snippet using an app for Mac called Alfred.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if I want to enter 2 stars I type&nbsp;",2s". S means stars. For 3 stars ",3s" and so on. And if you like books you&nbsp;will like Shortform. Shortform&nbsp;&nbsp; is one of my favorite apps to use with Obsidian.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are like super-powered book summaries, very&nbsp;detailed, covering all the book‚Äôs key ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortform covers every topic people care about,&nbsp;including work, productivity, and science. What I love is that you can learn a book at&nbsp;different levels. For a 10-minute overview,&nbsp;&nbsp; check out the 1-page summary that you can choose&nbsp;to read or listen to the full audio narration.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when you got some time you can&nbsp;go deeper, and read the full guide. 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=317)~~  They also add smart insights which connect&nbsp;the ideas in the book with ideas in other&nbsp;&nbsp; books like in this summary of Atomic&nbsp;Habits by James Clear that taught me&nbsp;&nbsp; how to develop habits in a more efficient way.&nbsp;Shortform publishes new book guides and also&nbsp;&nbsp; articles every week, and subscribers&nbsp;get to vote on what books to cover. To get a 5-day free trial, join&nbsp;Shortform through my special link,&nbsp;&nbsp; shortform.com/filipe, or click&nbsp;the link in the description. Now I want to show you how to add a new item. As I showed earlier, below each table I created&nbsp;a button to make it easy to add new items.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I click on it I fill in the title of this&nbsp;new note and automatically the template is&nbsp;&nbsp; inserted with all the fields for this type of&nbsp;note. If the new note is about a book the New&nbsp;&nbsp; Book button inserts the book-specific template&nbsp;and I just have to worry about writing my notes. This is only possible thanks to a plugin&nbsp;called QuickAdd that allows you to create&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=371)~~  commands for the creation of new pages.&nbsp;Here in the options of this plugin,&nbsp;&nbsp; I created 3 types of commands: Add Item for adding&nbsp;notes about some blog post I liked. Add Book for&nbsp;&nbsp; when I am reading a book, and Add Course for&nbsp;when I am taking a course or workshop. In the&nbsp;&nbsp; settings of each of these commands, I set&nbsp;a specific template that I want to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows me to quickly create a note&nbsp;with the right template, saving me time&nbsp;&nbsp; and reducing the chances of using the wrong&nbsp;template, which happened to me a few times. With this configured, you&nbsp;can enable it by clicking&nbsp;&nbsp; on this icon so that the command&nbsp;appears in the command palette.&nbsp;&nbsp; So from anywhere in Obsidian I can press&nbsp;Command + P and run for example Add book. To make it even easier I used another popular&nbsp;plugin called Obsidian Buttons. This is a very&nbsp;&nbsp; simple plugin that allows you to create&nbsp;buttons that can run commands. Here for&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 - ~~[‚ñ∂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1ylSiY9Gw&t=416)~~  example I created a button called New Book.&nbsp;In this case, the command is the one we set up&nbsp;&nbsp; using the QuickAdd plugin so the action, in this&nbsp;case, is "action QuickAdd: Add Book". The result&nbsp;&nbsp; is that when you click the button it performs the&nbsp;same action that appears in the command palette. If you want to check out this template&nbsp;I'll put a link to it down in the video&nbsp;&nbsp; description so you can use it or&nbsp;modify it to suit your own goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for watching and I&nbsp;see you in the next video.
