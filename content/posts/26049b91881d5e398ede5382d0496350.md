#### Develop location-aware apps for your business with our user friendly APIs and location services

Need to develop a location-aware app or answer location-related questions? Geoapify is a feature-rich location platform suitable for businesses of any size. We offer maps, address and location search, route optimization, reachability analysis, geodata access, and more.

Get started quickly with our code samples and tutorials. Not sure where to start? Get in touch and we'll be happy to answer all your questions.


What Is Geoapify Location Platform?
-----------------------------------

#### Our flexible platform gives you the building blocks to create maps, route optimization, and location intelligence apps

Our location platform streamlines map development and geospatial analytics applications. We believe in keeping things straightforward and easy to use. We offer core maps API, auxiliary APIs, and data services.

Our APIs return reliable, up-to-date location data you and your customers can trust. And our affordable prices leave you free to focus on your project without worrying about budget limits.

#### A Location Platform That Puts You In Control

We use open data for all our APIs, including processed data, which gives you complete control. Unlike other services, you can save your results on your side with no limits.

Give it a try today! Sign up and start using our API for free. Wondering if this is right for your business? Check out our API playground and see what you can build with our APIs.


Which Map API Do You Need?
--------------------------


#### We have an API for all your location based tasks


![](/static/c27ac528667287b3269eba960caeb5f2/map-styles.gif)### Maps

Create vector and raster maps you can use as a base-map layer for Leaflet, MapLibre GL, OpenLayers, QGIS, and other map libraries and GIS.

Or use our Static Maps API to generate map images and map markers. Choose between different map styles and colors to match your app and website design.


![](/static/ac9f5dd7edee7139d69663af0f4ef97c/geocoding-demo.gif)### Address and Location Search

Search places by name or address. Look up an address by its coordinates, or get user location from an IP address. Choose from a broad set of options to meet your business requirements. Our Geocoding API supports multiple languages.

You can download and use your results freely thanks to our permissive conditions.


![](/static/4c2a4fb10ba5ae0b129ef8690619b86b/places-api-demo.gif)### Places and Details

Search for amenities and points of interest, and return detailed information about them. Our APIs support a wide range of place types and categories.

You can filter results by location, bounding box, and isolines.


![](/static/fa68a3a847fd5aff25d41cff94111fb2/route-api-demo.gif)### Routes and Optimization

 Plan and calculate the best routes for one vehicle, or a whole fleet. Get route geometry, road attributes, and turn-by-turn directions.

 Our flexible location platform makes it easy to create and plan routes for logistics and delivery companies. From postal services to food delivery, and from maintenance and care workers, to store deliveries, our platform gives you the routing tools you need.

* [Routing API](/routing-api/)
* [Route Matrix API](/route-matrix-api/) - calculate distance and time between multiple points
* [Map Matching API](/map-matching-api/) - match GPS coordinates to existing roads
* [Route Planner API](/route-planner-api/) - solve VRP related tasks


![](/static/def61d1dea31762b9f1f931ddc4a6932/isoline-api-demo.gif)### Isolines API

Isolines show what areas are reachable within a given time or travel distance and are great for analytics, logistics, and calculating service areas.

We offer isochrones and isodistances for multiple modes of transport including drive, truck, bicycle, walk, and transit. Find reachable areas up to 5 hours or 1000 kilometers wide.

* [Isolines API](/isoline-api/) - isochrones and isodistances
* [Geometry API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/geometry) - find union or intersection of several areas


Don't see a feature or API you need? [Get in touch with us](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#127b7c747d5275777d73627b746b3c717d7f) and we'll be glad to help you.

FAQ
---

##### What is a location platform?

A location platform provides the location APIs, components, and geodata you need to develop location-based applications and maps.

##### What do I need to develop a location-aware application?

A location-aware app requires location services such as address search, route builders, and geodata. Geoapify Location Platform APIs give you access to the geospatial services and data you need to build map applications and location components.

##### How can I use Maps API for free?

1. Register and get an API key on the [Geoapify MyProject page](https://myprojects.geoapify.com/). 


2. Learn how to use APIs on the [API Docs](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/) page or generate an API link with the [Playground](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/). 


3. When you stay within the [Free pricing](pricing/) plan quota, you can use the Maps API for free, even for a commercial app.


##### Can I store the data I received by using Maps API?

We know how important it is to have control of the data you generate. You are free to download and store all the data and components you create with Geoapify. But please remember the required OpenStreetMap attribution. By default, the attribution is provided as a part of the result object. If you are on a Free plan, please also add a "follow" link on your website to attribute Geoapify as data provider:
