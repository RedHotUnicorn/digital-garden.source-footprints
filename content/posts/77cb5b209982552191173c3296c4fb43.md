[1st place Primary by Cecilia May](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary)

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary/main/assets/primary-heroimg.png)](#primary)

 Primary is soft, chewy, comforting — like a chocolate chip cookie, or a warm brownie. Primary
 instantly
 puts you in a relaxed state that opens the door to creativity and exploration. Wonderfully executed
 down
 to the smallest details, Primary ran away with first place.
 



[Runner-up #1 Sanctum by jdanielmourao](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum) 

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum/main/cover.png)](#sanctum)

 Sanctum is precise, functional, yet infused with personality. It brings a style of UI that evokes
 the best e-ink devices: high contrast, minimal, leaving no ambiguity. Sanctum makes you feel like a
 genius, as if you're using the tool one might wield to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, or type out the
 next great novel.
 



[Runner-up #2 Prism by Damian Korcz](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Prism-Theme) 

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damiankorcz/Obsidian-Prism/main/assets/screenshots/Community%20Themes%20Screenshot.png)](#prism)

 Prism is a compartmentalist's dream. Everything has a place, and there's a place for everything.
 With a plethora of customization options, Prism makes it easy to craft a space that feels
 personal
 yet organized.
 



[Runner-up #3 Bubble Space by Emrie
 Candera](https://github.com/Emrie-Candera/Bubble-Space-Theme)

 Our honorable mention goes to Bubble Space, an unapologetically fun and colorful theme. With its
 cartoon-inspired visuals, Bubble Space gives Obsidian an approachable and exciting character.

[Winner CodeMirror Options by
 NothingIsLost](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-codemirror-options) 

[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89109712/139353712-622d9f53-cb69-49dd-a24d-8d14071d497e.gif)](#codemirror-options)

 Before there was Live Preview, there was CodeMirror Options. It’s a plugin about choice: go full on
 what-you-see-is-what-you-get editing or simply see your dataview code blocks rendered without losing
 your place as you write. CodeMirror Options empowers users to design an editing experience to suit
 their
 unique needs. Who said a wall of toggles was bad UX design?
 



[Runner-up #1 Fantasy Calendar by Jeremy
 Valentine](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-fantasy-calendar) 

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentine195/obsidian-fantasy-calendar/master/assets/example.png)](#fantasy-calendar)

 Javalent spoils TTRPG fans yet again with another beautiful plugin. Fantasy Calendar is a
 full-featured
 tracker for your fantasy worlds. Despite the name, it’s a suitable tracker for the real world, too.
 Create events, manage multiple calendars, open a full-screen view of your month—this might just be
 *the*
 definitive calendar for Obsidian.
 



[Runner-up #2 Graph Analysis by
 SkepticMystic & Emile](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/graph-analysis) 

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c8f9c25c9160db2ec92d517220fe2d3a135067ab0d27088a1effc7b4ba6c0c84/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7564506b7556332e706e67)](#graph-analysis)

 Graph Analysis is a brilliantly nerdy plugin that helps users derive rich insights from their
 notes using mathematical wizardry. It packages proven algorithms in such an approachable way
 that even if you're as clueless as me, you'll love clicking around!
 



[Runner-up #3 Vale by Marcus Olsson](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-vale) 

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-vale/main/screenshot.png)](#vale)

 Vale is good. Vale helps you write very, very good. With so many plugins helping you write
 *more*, Vale checks your writing for consistent style, syntax, spelling, and grammar. And
 it does so entirely offline—privacy nerds rejoice! This plugin is wonderfully simple and
 delightful to use. It truly embraces the do-one-thing-well philosophy.
