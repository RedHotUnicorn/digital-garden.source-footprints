 Last year, we introduced OpenProject in our non-profit project "fLotte Berlin" to organize all the tasks related to the operation of 250 cargo bikes that can be borrowed free of charge. Since then, the communication effort in our team has decreased significantly, our response times have improved noticeably and the processes have become more structured and transparent. During the introductory phase, OpenProject provided us with amazing support. Thank you again!
