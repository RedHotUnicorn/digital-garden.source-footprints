History of Philosophy
---------------------


This is my ever-growing summary of the history of (Western) philosophy showing the positive/negative connections between some of the key ideas/arguments/statements of the philosophers. It is not an automated text analysis project: the content and the connections are the result of my personal efforts of reading and note-taking, so it’s a never-ending work-in-progress – my main area of non-academic research since 2014.
To browse it in detail (with interaction) and to read more about it, you can go to [History of Philosophy](http://www.denizcemonduygu.com/philo/). (Best viewed in Chrome, desktop.)  

  




I am deeply thankful to [Hüseyin Kuşçu](http://www.huseyinkuscu.com/) who offered his programming skills for the creation of the interactive version. I also thank my friend [Eser Aygün](http://www.eseraygun.com) for writing the program that automatized to a great degree the transition between the spreadsheet that I fill in and the visualization, for the static version in the beginning of this project. (The current version is way beyond being printable and hangable on a wall in terms of size.)


* 2014–ongoing

This print was from an old version (2014); it had a lot less content than the current one which is beyond being printable and hangable on a wall.
