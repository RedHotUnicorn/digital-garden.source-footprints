txtai is an all-in-one embeddings database for semantic search, LLM orchestration and language model workflows.


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/architecture.png#gh-light-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/architecture.png#gh-light-mode-only)
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/architecture-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/architecture-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


Embeddings databases are a union of vector indexes (sparse and dense), graph networks and relational databases. This enables vector search with SQL, topic modeling, retrieval augmented generation and more.


Embeddings databases can stand on their own and/or serve as a powerful knowledge source for large language model (LLM) prompts.


Summary of txtai features:


* üîé Vector search with SQL, object storage, topic modeling, graph analysis and multimodal indexing
* üìÑ Create embeddings for text, documents, audio, images and video
* üí° Pipelines powered by language models that run LLM prompts, question-answering, labeling, transcription, translation, summarization and more
* ‚Ü™Ô∏èÔ∏è Workflows to join pipelines together and aggregate business logic. txtai processes can be simple microservices or multi-model workflows.
* ‚öôÔ∏è Build with Python or YAML. API bindings available for [JavaScript](https://github.com/neuml/txtai.js), [Java](https://github.com/neuml/txtai.java), [Rust](https://github.com/neuml/txtai.rs) and [Go](https://github.com/neuml/txtai.go).
* ‚òÅÔ∏è Run local or scale out with container orchestration


txtai is built with Python 3.8+, [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi). txtai is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license.

Why txtai?
----------


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/why.png#gh-light-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/why.png#gh-light-mode-only)

New vector databases, LLM frameworks and everything in between are sprouting up daily. Why build with txtai?


* Up and running in minutes with [pip](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/install/) or [Docker](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/cloud/)



```
# Get started in a couple lines
import txtai

embeddings = txtai.Embeddings()
embeddings.index(["Correct", "Not what we hoped"])
embeddings.search("positive", 1)
#[(0, 0.29862046241760254)]
```

* Built-in API makes it easy to develop applications using your programming language of choice



```
# app.yml
embeddings:
    path: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```


```
CONFIG=app.yml uvicorn "txtai.api:app"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/search?query=positive"
```

* Run local - no need to ship data off to disparate remote services
* Work with micromodels all the way up to large language models (LLMs)
* Low footprint - install additional dependencies and scale up when needed
* [Learn by example](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/examples) - notebooks cover all available functionality


Use Cases
---------


The following sections introduce common txtai use cases. A comprehensive set of over 50 [example notebooks and applications](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/examples) are also available.


### Semantic Search


Build semantic/similarity/vector/neural search applications.


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/demo.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/demo.gif)


Traditional search systems use keywords to find data. Semantic search has an understanding of natural language and identifies results that have the same meaning, not necessarily the same keywords.


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/search.png#gh-light-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/search.png#gh-light-mode-only)
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/search-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/search-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


Get started with the following examples.




| Notebook | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Overview of the functionality provided by txtai |  |
| [Similarity search with images](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/13_Similarity_search_with_images.ipynb) | Embed images and text into the same space for search |  |
| [Build a QA database](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/34_Build_a_QA_database.ipynb) | Question matching with semantic search |  |
| [Semantic Graphs](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/38_Introducing_the_Semantic_Graph.ipynb) | Explore topics, data connectivity and run network analysis |  |


### LLM Orchestration


LLM chains, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), chat with your data, pipelines and workflows that interface with large language models (LLMs).


#### Chains


Integrate LLM chains (known as workflows in txtai), multiple LLM agents and self-critique.


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/llm.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/llm.png)


See below to learn more.




| Notebook | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Prompt templates and task chains](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/44_Prompt_templates_and_task_chains.ipynb) | Build model prompts and connect tasks together with workflows |  |
| [Integrate LLM frameworks](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/53_Integrate_LLM_Frameworks.ipynb) | Integrate llama.cpp, LiteLLM and custom generation frameworks |  |

#### Retrieval augmented generation


Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) reduces the risk of LLM hallucinations by constraining the output with a knowledge base as context. RAG is commonly used to "chat with your data".


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/rag.png#gh-light-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/rag.png#gh-light-mode-only)
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/rag-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/rag-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


A novel feature of txtai is that it can provide both an answer and source citation.

### Language Model Workflows


Language model workflows, also known as semantic workflows, connect language models together to build intelligent applications.


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/flows.png#gh-light-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/flows.png#gh-light-mode-only)
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/flows-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/flows-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


While LLMs are powerful, there are plenty of smaller, more specialized models that work better and faster for specific tasks. This includes models for extractive question-answering, automatic summarization, text-to-speech, transcription and translation.




| Notebook | Description |
| --- | --- |

| [Building abstractive text summaries](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/09_Building_abstractive_text_summaries.ipynb) | Run abstractive text summarization |  |
| [Transcribe audio to text](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/11_Transcribe_audio_to_text.ipynb) | Convert audio files to text |  |
| [Translate text between languages](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/12_Translate_text_between_languages.ipynb) | Streamline machine translation and language detection |  |

Model guide
-----------


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/models.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuml/txtai/master/docs/images/models.png)


See the table below for the current recommended models. These models all allow commercial use and offer a blend of speed and performance.




| Component | Model(s) |
| --- | --- |
| [Labels - Fixed](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/pipeline/text/labels) | Fine-tune with [training pipeline](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/pipeline/train/trainer) |


Models can be loaded as either a path from the Hugging Face Hub or a local directory. Model paths are optional, defaults are loaded when not specified. For tasks with no recommended model, txtai uses the default models as shown in the Hugging Face Tasks guide.
