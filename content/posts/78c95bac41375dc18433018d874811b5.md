Tropy
=====


Explore your research photos


[Download Tropy](https://github.com/tropy/tropy/releases/latest)

Built for today’s archival research
-----------------------------------


Take control of your research photos with Tropy, a tool that shortens the path from finding archival sources to writing about them. Spend more time using your research photos, and less time hunting for them.


### Turn photos into items


Tropy thinks the way you do: like a researcher. Say goodbye to IMG\_5261.JPG and IMG\_5262.JPG, and say hello to your sources.

### Describe your sources


Tropy helps you contextualize artifacts and their photos by capturing your own subject expertise. A friendly editing interface allows customized templates that fit your research like a glove.

### Organize your research


Tropy understands that every researcher is different and that every project has its own demands. Break free from the logic of the physical archive and use tags and lists to organize your research items according to your needs.
