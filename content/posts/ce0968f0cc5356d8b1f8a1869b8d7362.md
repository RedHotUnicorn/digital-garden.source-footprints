Judging by the answer you gave in response to @Ozzie, I'm not sure you can do what you want.


You can export the metadata of an 11gR2 database using expdp (Data Pump) and the METADATA\_ONLY flag. See [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882\_01/server.112/e22490/dp\_export.htm](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e22490/dp_export.htm)


This will export the structure of your data. This won't include redologs, controlfiles, the supporting files required for the instance.


To recover using this export, you would need to create a new database instance using dbca which has all the logs and supporting structure set up, and then import the metadata using impdp.


If you had a copy of the data files, you could also use transportable tablespaces to move the data to the new instance.


The normal method for backing up the entire database is RMAN. This will include everything that you need to restore the database. I don't believe that RMAN provides the option to exclude the data, though.


It may help if you can explain what you are trying to achieve, then better options may be available.
