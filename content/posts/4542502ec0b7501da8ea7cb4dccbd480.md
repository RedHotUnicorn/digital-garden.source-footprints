Local REST API for Obsidian
===========================


See our interactive docs: [https://coddingtonbear.github.io/obsidian-local-rest-api/](https://coddingtonbear.github.io/obsidian-local-rest-api/)


Have you ever needed to automate interacting with your notes? This plugin gives Obsidian a REST API you can interact with your notes from other tools so you can automate what you need to automate.


This plugin provides a secure HTTPS interface gated behind api key authentication that allows you to:


* Read, create, update or delete existing notes. There's even a `PATCH` HTTP method for inserting content into a particular section of a note.
* List notes stored in your vault.
* Create and fetch periodic notes.
* Execute commands and list what commands are available.


This is particularly useful if you need to interact with Obsidian from a browser extension like [Obsidian Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-web/edoacekkjanmingkbkgjndndibhkegad).

This was inspired by [Vinzent03](https://github.com/Vinzent03)'s [advanced-uri plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) with hopes of expanding the automation options beyond the limitations of custom URL schemes.
