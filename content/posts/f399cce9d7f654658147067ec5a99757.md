Introduction
------------


The way we formulate knowledge in learning has a monumental impact on memory. Well-phrased questions make learning easy. Well-structured knowledge will help keep it in memory for life.


**[Effective learning: 20 rules of knowledge formulation](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)**, compiled in 1999, describes the most important rules needed to effectively formulate good questions for long-term [retention](/wiki/Retention "Retention"). Below I provide a concise executive summary (esp. for those interested in [incremental reading](/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading")).



Summary: 20 rules
-----------------


* [don't learn things that you do not understand](/wiki/Do_not_memorize_before_you_understand "Do not memorize before you understand")
* learn before you memorize
* start from basics before going into complexities
* [keep questions simple](/wiki/Simple_questions_in_spaced_repetition "Simple questions in spaced repetition")
* pictures assist memory
* learn mnemonic techniques, e.g. peg lists
* avoid lists, sets and enumerations (they can be tackled with [cloze deletion](/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") as in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ktH-TceHx8))
* personalize and provide examples
* [cloze deletion](/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") is fast and has a great [mnemonic power](/wiki/Mnemonic_anchor "Mnemonic anchor")
* use [redundancy](/wiki/Redundancy "Redundancy") (similar [items](/wiki/Item "Item") asking similar questions from different angles)
* use [references](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References)


New rules: incremental reading
------------------------------


With the advent of [incremental reading](/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), the rules have been modified, and re-prioritized.


Changes of formulation strategy in [incremental reading](/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"):



* building comprehension may be part of the learning process, and creating [cloze deletions](/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") on poorly understood phrases is acceptable
* learning and memorization may occur in parallel (see: [video](https://youtu.be/XRuLV2_A3Ts))
* early in the learning process, [items](/wiki/Item "Item") may be [complex](/wiki/Complexity "Complexity"). They [get simplified incrementally](/wiki/Simple_questions_in_spaced_repetition "Simple questions in spaced repetition") depending on [knowledge priority](/wiki/Priority_queue "Priority queue"), and the available time
* multiple [cloze deletions](/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") on different formulations of the same statement may often substitute for mnemonic techniques (see: [Knowledge darwinism](/wiki/Knowledge_darwinism "Knowledge darwinism"))
* lists, sets, and enumerations can be easily tackled with [cloze deletion](/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") (see: [video](https://youtu.be/AmpdWZEAX3Q))
* for personalization, add your own stories to texts that you learn. [Elaborate creatively](/wiki/Incremental_writing "Incremental writing")


A simple and universal litmus test for a good formulation is [pleasure of learning](/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning "Pleasure of learning"). Each time you see a drop in pleasure, come back to this text and see if you can find a rule violation that might be responsible for the decline in fun.



We should strive at maximum [applicability](/wiki/Applicability "Applicability") of knowledge.


[Human intelligence](/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence "Simple formula for high intelligence") is based on knowledge, of which **[abstract knowledge](/wiki/Abstract_knowledge "Abstract knowledge")** plays a particularly important role. Abstract knowledge is based on rules, such as 2+2=4. Such rules may be employed in multiple contexts and contribute to problem solving capacity. Rules are more useful than facts. For example, it is more useful to know that 2+2=4 (rule) than to know that a friends's phone number beings with *4* (fact). Rules and formulas are more [applicable](/wiki/Applicability "Applicability") than facts. For more details see: [Abstract knowledge](/wiki/Abstract_knowledge "Abstract knowledge")



In representing knowledge, we should always strive at formulating **[atomic memories](/wiki/Complexity "Complexity")** set in a good context of comprehension. If learning is enjoyable, [items](/wiki/Item "Item") are probably formulated pretty well. The picture explains why simple memories are easier to [retain](/wiki/Retention "Retention"):

Memory complexity: simple and complex memories



> ***Figure:** **[Memory complexity](/wiki/Memory_complexity "Memory complexity")** illustrates the importance of the [minimum information principle](/wiki/Minimum_information_principle "Minimum information principle"). When memorizing simple questions and answers, we can rely on a simple memory connection, and uniformly refresh that connection at review. Complex memories may have their concepts activated in an incomplete fashion, or in a different sequence that depends on the context. As a result, it is hard to produce a uniform increase in [memory stability](/wiki/Memory_stability "Memory stability") at review. Complex items are difficult to remember. An example of a simple item may be a word pair, e.g.* apple = pomo *(Esperanto). While a complex net of connection may be needed to recognize an apple. The connection between* apple *and* pomo *is irreducible (i.e. maximally simplified)*
