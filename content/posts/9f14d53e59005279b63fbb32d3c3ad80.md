Below you'll find:

* A curated list of my best pieces of content on gamification
* My favorite outside resources to consume on gamification

**This is the Gamification resource list I wish I had 3 years ago.**

**I recommend save 1-2 pieces of content in each section and come back to this list later as you learn more.** I HIGHLY recommend you start with my pillar piece, [Life Is A Game: Here's How You Play.](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/aip-71-life-is-a-game-heres-how-you-play/)

Don’t overwhelm yourself, have fun! 🎊

👋Hi, I'm Aidan Helfant!
=======================

![](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/content/images/2023/12/WhatsApp-Image-Black-Shirt--1-.jpg)I used to be addicted to video games like a fish is addicted to water.

Now I have turned real life into a game. **I have reignited my childhood curiosity** and fallen back in love with learning. Having invested more than **1000+ hours into learning to gamify my health, work, relationships, and learning,** I want to teach you what I've learned in a fraction of the time.
