VisuAlgo is a trilingual site. Try visiting the other versions of VisuAlgo other than the default [English version](./en), e.g., [Chinese](./zh) or [Indonesian](./id). Users can see the [translation statistics](./statistics) for these three pages. We aim to make all three has near 100% translation rate. Unfortunately the translation progress with other languages are too far behind and they are thus redirected to English.


In VisuAlgo, you can use *your own input* for any algorithm instead of using only the provided sample inputs. This is one of the key feature of VisuAlgo. Try the graph drawing feature in these 9 graph-related visualizations: [Graph DS](./en/graphds), [DFS/BFS](./en/dfsbfs), [MST](./en/mst), [SSSP](./en/sssp), [Max Flow](./en/maxflow), [Matching](./en/matching), [MVC](./en/mvc), [Steiner Tree](./en/steinertree), and [TSP](./en/TSP). You can also click tag *'graph'* in any of these 9 graph-related visualization boxes or type in *'graph'* in the search box.


Here are some of the newer visualization features: ability to show two visualization scales (1.0x and 0.5x), the zoom-out scale is used to show operations of a slightly bigger test cases, [/list](./en/list) (the linked list are no longer automatically re-layout for most cases to strengthen the O(1) impression of almost all Linked List operations).


Breaking news [Fri, 09 Jun 23]: VisuAlgo project is funded by [Optiver](https://optiver.com) starting today. We now open VisuAlgo account registration to every Computer Science students/teachers worldwide. Go to the [login page](https://visualgo.net/login) and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new VisuAlgo account (no longer restricted to 'nus.edu'-related emails).


To compare 2 related algorithms, e.g., [Kruskal's vs Prim's](./en/mst) on the same graph, or 2 related operations of the same data structure, e.g., visualizing [Binary (Max) Heap](./en/heap) as a Binary Tree or as a Compact Array, open 2 VisuAlgo pages in 2 windows and juxtapose them. Click [here](img/kruskalprim.png) to see the screenshot. This juxtaposition technique can be used anytime you want to compare two similar data structures or algorithms.


You can visualize the recursion tree (or DAG, if there are overlapping subproblems and Dynamic Programming (DP) is applicable) of **ANY** valid [recursive function](./en/recursion) that can be written in JavaScript. Click [here](img/recursion_treedag.png) to see the screenshot. Obviously do not try visualizing recursion with a gigantic recursion tree as doing so will crash your own web browser/computer.


VisuAlgo loads fast for first time visitors (we use Cloudflare global CDN), but it loads 'almost instantly' for returning visitors as we also cache lots of static content of VisuAlgo :). So, do not use incognito or private browsing mode to keep the cache. Moreover, for NUS students with VisuAlgo accounts, we will load VisuAlgo according to your preferences/class setup after you [login](/login).


Each visualization page has an 'e-Lecture Mode' that is accessible from that page's top right corner. This mode is automatically shown to first time (or non logged-in) visitors to showcase the data structure or algorithm being visualized. The quality of e-Lecture mode for many visualization pages have reached the lecture standard of algorithm classes in National University of Singapore :).


Please check the newest features of VisuAlgo: 1). User accounts system for NUS students and verified CS lecturers worldwide (and also read the latest Privacy Policy popup at the bottom right corner), 2). More mobile-friendly setup, 3). More polished e-Lecture notes to reach "NUS standard", and 4). Trilingual capability (/en, /zh, or /id).


VisuAlgo has two main components: The 24 visualization pages and their associated Online Quiz component (more questions are currently being added into the question bank). We do not script any of the questions in Online Quiz :O and all answers will be graded almost instantly :). You can this online quiz system by clicking the 'Training' button on the visualization module.

#### About

✕

Initially conceived in 2011 by Associate Professor Steven Halim, VisuAlgo aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms for his students by providing a self-paced, interactive learning platform.

Featuring numerous advanced algorithms discussed in Dr. Steven Halim's book, 'Competitive Programming' — co-authored with Dr. Felix Halim and Dr. Suhendry Effendy — VisuAlgo remains the exclusive platform for visualizing and animating several of these complex algorithms even after a decade.

While primarily designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) students enrolled in various data structure and algorithm courses (e.g., CS1010/equivalent, CS2040/equivalent (including IT5003), CS3230, CS3233, and CS4234), VisuAlgo also serves as a valuable resource for inquisitive minds worldwide, promoting online learning.

Initially, VisuAlgo was not designed for small touch screens like smartphones, as intricate algorithm visualizations required substantial pixel space and click-and-drag interactions. For an optimal user experience, a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768 is recommended. However, since April 2022, a mobile (lite) version of VisuAlgo has been made available, making it possible to use a subset of VisuAlgo features on smartphone screens.

VisuAlgo remains a work in progress, with the ongoing development of more complex visualizations. At present, the platform features 24 visualization modules.

Equipped with a built-in question generator and answer verifier, VisuAlgo's "online quiz system" enables students to test their knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. Questions are randomly generated based on specific rules, and students' answers are automatically graded upon submission to our grading server. As more CS instructors adopt this online quiz system worldwide, it could effectively eliminate manual basic data structure and algorithm questions from standard Computer Science exams in many universities. By assigning a small (but non-zero) weight to passing the online quiz, CS instructors can significantly enhance their students' mastery of these basic concepts, as they have access to an almost unlimited number of practice questions that can be instantly verified before taking the online quiz. Each VisuAlgo visualization module now includes its own online quiz component.

VisuAlgo has been translated into three primary languages: English, Chinese, and Indonesian. Additionally, we have authored public notes about VisuAlgo in various languages, including Indonesian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai:

#### Terms of use

✕

VisuAlgo is generously offered at no cost to the global Computer Science community. If you appreciate VisuAlgo, we kindly request that you **spread the word about its existence to fellow Computer Science students and instructors**. You can share VisuAlgo through social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc), course webpages, blog reviews, emails, and more.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) students and instructors are welcome to use this website directly for their classes. If you capture screenshots or videos from this site, feel free to use them elsewhere, provided that you cite the URL of this website ([https://visualgo.net](https://visualgo.net)) and/or the list of publications below as references. However, please refrain from downloading VisuAlgo's client-side files and hosting them on your website, as this constitutes plagiarism. At this time, we do not permit others to fork this project or create VisuAlgo variants. Personal use of an offline copy of the client-side VisuAlgo is acceptable.

Please note that VisuAlgo's online quiz component has a substantial server-side element, and it is not easy to save server-side scripts and databases locally. Currently, the general public can access the online quiz system only through the 'training mode.' The 'test mode' offers a more controlled environment for using randomly generated questions and automatic verification in real examinations at NUS.

**List of Publications**

 This work has been presented at the CLI Workshop at the ICPC World Finals 2012 (Poland, Warsaw) and at the IOI Conference at IOI 2012 (Sirmione-Montichiari, Italy). You can click [this link](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/INFOL099.pdf) to read our 2012 paper about this system (it was not yet called VisuAlgo back in 2012) and [this link](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/v9_2015_243_245.pdf) for the short update in 2015 (to link VisuAlgo name with the previous project).

#### Privacy Policy

✕

**Version 1.2 (Updated Fri, 18 Aug 2023).**

Since Fri, 18 Aug 2023, we no longer use Google Analytics. Thus, all cookies that we use now are solely for the operations of this website. The annoying cookie-consent popup is now turned off even for first-time visitors.

Since Fri, 07 Jun 2023, thanks to a generous donation by Optiver, anyone in the world can self-create a VisuAlgo account to store a few customization settings (e.g., layout mode, default language, playback speed, etc).

Additionally, for NUS students, by using a VisuAlgo account (a tuple of NUS official email address, student name as in the class roster, and a password that is encrypted on the server side — no other personal data is stored), you are giving a consent for your course lecturer to keep track of your e-lecture slides reading and online quiz training progresses that is needed to run the course smoothly. Your VisuAlgo account will also be needed for taking NUS official VisuAlgo Online Quizzes and thus passing your account credentials to another person to do the Online Quiz on your behalf constitutes an academic offense. Your user account will be purged after the conclusion of the course unless you choose to keep your account (OPT-IN). Access to the full VisuAlgo database (with encrypted passwords) is limited to Prof Halim himself.

For other CS lecturers worldwide who have written to Steven, a VisuAlgo account (your (non-NUS) email address, you can use any display name, and encrypted password) is needed to distinguish your online credential versus the rest of the world. Your account will have CS lecturer specific features, namely the ability to see the hidden slides that contain (interesting) answers to the questions presented in the preceding slides before the hidden slides. You can also access Hard setting of the VisuAlgo Online Quizzes. You can freely use the material to enhance your data structures and algorithm classes. Note that there can be other CS lecturer specific features in the future.  


For anyone with VisuAlgo account, you can remove your own account by yourself should you wish to no longer be associated with VisuAlgo tool.
