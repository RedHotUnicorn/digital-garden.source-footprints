No notifications. No ads. No sign-up.  
Just you and your time.  
  
  
LIFE DESCRIPTION  
  
Sometimes Life seems really short, and other times impossibly long.  
This app will help you to emphasize that itâ€™s most certainly finite.  
Life shows you, the days, months, and years you have left and that they are all you have got.  
Donâ€™t be afraid, that means the only appropriate word to describe your time left is â€œpreciousâ€.  
So I hope this app will enable you to create a Life in which you will be happy and creative.  
  
  
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY?  
  
I think Privacy is a fundamental human right.  
To that end, I have designed Life from the ground up without any external framework.  
In this way, your data, like your birthdate, stays entirely private.  
  
  
HOW CAN YOU HELP ME?  
  
As I donâ€™t collect any data on this app, to improve it I need your help!  
You can send me an email to julien@lacroix.dev for any feedback, issues, or bugs on this app or just to say â€œHello!â€.  
  
I answer every email!

A special thank you to Wait But Why for this amazing article (https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).  
Without their work, this app would not have seen the light of day.
