About
-----


Project VimR is a Neovim GUI for macOS written in Swift.


The goal is to build an editor that uses Neovim inside with many of the convenience
GUI features similar to those present in modern editors. We mainly use Swift,
but also use C/Objective-C when where appropriate.


There are other Neovim GUIs for macOS, see the [list](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#gui), so why?


* Play around with [Neovim](https://github.com/qvacua/neovim),
* play around with Swift (and especially with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)),
* Play around with the main idea of Redux architecture, and
* (most importantly) have fun!
