6.2 Machine learning as programming paradigm
--------------------------------------------


* ML reflects a different programming paradigm (Chollet and Allaire [2018](#ref-Chollet2018-vf), Chap. 1.1.2)
* Machine learning arises from this question: *could a computer […] learn on its own how to perform a specified task? […] Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?*

* Classical programming (paradigm of [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence))
	+ Humans input rules (a program) and data to be processed according to these rules, and out come answers
* Machine learning paradigm
	+ Humans input data + answers expected from the data, and out come the rules [these rules can then be applied to new data]
* ML system is trained rather than explicitly programmed
	+ Trained: Presented with many examples relevant to a task &rarr finds statistical structure in these examples &rarr allows system to come up with rules for automating the task (remember [Alpha Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y))
* Role of math
	+ While related to math. statistics, ML tends to deal with large, complex datasets (e.g., millions of images, each consisting of thousands of pixels)
	+ As a result ML (especially deep learning) exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory and is engineering oriented (ideas proven more often empirically than mathematically) (Chollet and Allaire [2018](#ref-Chollet2018-vf), Chap. 1.1.2)
