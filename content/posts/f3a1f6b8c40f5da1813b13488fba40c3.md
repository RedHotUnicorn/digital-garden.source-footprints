What are file naming conventions?

To maximize access to your records, we recommend establishing a naming convention for your files.


A file naming convention is a framework for naming your files in a way that describes what they contain and how they relate to other files.


File naming conventions help you stay organized and quickly identify your files. In a shared or collaborative group file-sharing setting, it will help others more easily navigate your work.


It is ***essential*** to establish a convention ***before*** you begin collecting files or data in order to prevent a backlog of unorganized content that will lead to misplaced or lost data!
