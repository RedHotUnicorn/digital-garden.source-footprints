### Create personal collections

KeyCombiner makes it very easy to create a collection with all your shortcuts by importing them from [public collections](/collections/).

Of course, you can modify, duplicate, and move around combinations once they are in your collections.

Need a shortcut we do not yet have in any public collection? You can always add it yourself.

Organize and Learn Shortcuts
----------------------------

Learn your collections flash-card style. Spaced repetition algorithms maximize learning efficiency.

Leveraging KeyCombiner's extensive collection building features, you can learn exactly the keyboard shortcuts you need and want to use. Similar to how you create playlists in music software, KeyCombiner lets you import shortcuts from [a public database](/collections/) into your own collections.

No pre-defined drills with things you will never need.

### Take Curated Courses and Lessons

KeyCombiner comes with an ever-growing [set of manually curated courses](/courses/). They come with pre-defined lessons that are small and easy to grasp.

Every course and lesson is created by a domain expert to maximize your learning progress and gradually build up your shortcut knowledge. An application's most important shortcuts are typically learned within the first few lessons of a course.

Even with pre-defined lessons, you can change any combination's keys to fit your custom bindings or keyboard layout. Any taken lesson's combinations will also show up in [KeyCombiner Desktop's](/desktop/) instant lookup.

Improve Accuracy
----------------

During training, KeyCombiner gathers detailed statistics, recording the number of errors and even the time you take for a specific key combination. 

 This will help you identify bad habits and common mistakes.

For each shortcut or text snipppet in your collections and lessons, KeyCombiner calculates a confidence score based on your practice performance.

The confidence score takes into account how often you typed a combination correctly, how often you skipped it, how often you made an error while typing it, and how long you took on average. This will give a very quick overview which combinations you have already internalized.
